description: >
  Read a large two-sided message corpus by hand, in date order, in small
  windows, and derive a timeline of real events plus a working-notes ledger.
  Use when asked to read, work through, continue, or resume a message record
  (the Annie corpus, or any equivalent thread) — anything of the form "keep
  reading the messages", "continue the annie record", "build the timeline from
  the texts". Do NOT use for keyword lookups in a corpus; that is
  `bin/mine-messages`.

# corpus-read — deriving a timeline by reading, not extracting

## 0. What this skill is for, and the one thing it refuses to do

You are given a message corpus of tens or hundreds of thousands of messages
between two people over years. You produce two things, incrementally, window by
window:

1. **A chronology** — dated events, each anchored to verbatim message text.
2. **A working-notes page** — everything the same window established that is
   *not* a dated event: entities, open leads, motifs, corrections, counts.

**The refusal: you do not pattern-match.** No regex sweep, no "extract lines
containing a date", no LLM-summarize-the-chunk. This is not a stylistic
preference, it is the finding that created this skill. Two mechanical passes
over this exact material (2026-08-14 and its 2026-08-15 replacement) produced
timeline pages where a large share of the "events" were prose fragments, edit
stamps and corpus metadata — because **a date next to a sentence is not an
event, and nothing that works on surface form can tell the difference.** The
first hand-read pass produced 33 events from 1,539 messages, of which the
mechanical passes had found *zero*, because none of them are stated anywhere as
a dated sentence. They exist only as things two people did.

If you find yourself writing a script to find events, you have left this skill.
Scripts are for *assembling and paging* the corpus. Judgement is for reading it.

---

## 1. Preconditions — assemble the corpus and prove it

Never read a single export. A long relationship migrates across handles, and
any one file silently drops years.

### 1.1 Establish every handle the subject used

Before building anything, enumerate the counterparty's handles and their date
ranges. In this corpus:

| Handle | Active | How it was established |
|---|---|---|
| `+17244346811` | 2015-11 → 2018-12 | original number |
| `+17249204125` | 2018-12 → 2020-06 | *"I texted her yesterday from my new number!"* (2018-12-27), later operator-confirmed |
| `alulmer28@gmail.com` | 2020-07 → 2020-10 | iMessage email handle on the same Apple ID |
| `+12124702449` | 2022, then 2025-03 → 2026-06 | the NYC number |

**The email handle is the trap.** An operator listing "her numbers" will list
phone numbers and omit it, because to them it is not a phone number. It is the
*only* source for autumn 2020 (~800 messages). Losing it deletes a season.
Generalise: when a handle list comes from a human, ask what it excludes by
construction.

### 1.2 Build, de-duplicate, sort

`bin/annie-corpus build` merges every export carrying the subject's traffic into
one de-duplicated, chronologically sorted CSV. Read `bin/annie-corpus` before
running it; the two things that matter:

- **De-duplication key is `(timestamp, direction, text)`.** Exports overlap
  heavily — one source contributed 94,855 new rows and the next contributed 0.
  That is expected, not a bug.
- **The blank-contact rule.** In a per-contact export (`imessage_<numbers>_…`)
  a `sent` row has an empty contact field — the contact is implied by the
  filename. In an all-contacts export the same blank means *unattributable*.
  Blanks may be claimed for the subject **only** from subject-scoped files.
  Getting this backwards silently imports other people's messages into the
  record.

### 1.3 Prove the build before you read a line

Run `build` and `coverage`, and check the totals against what the chronology
page already claims. A correct rebuild here reproduces **97,768 unique messages,
2015-11-28 18:47:54 → 2026-06-05 00:37:42**. If your number differs, stop and
find out why before reading — every downstream percentage is wrong otherwise.

---

## 2. Map coverage, and declare the holes as holes

Run `bin/annie-corpus coverage`. You get messages-per-month with `·` for zero.

**The governing rule, from `EXTRACTION_SPEC.md`: a zero is data only when the
system could have observed a one.** A month with no messages is a hole in the
*archive*. It is not a quiet period in the *relationship*, and no page and no
downstream synthesis may treat it as one.

This corpus's holes, and how to state them:

- **2020-11 → 2024-12 — 5 messages in four years.** Four years of a ten-year
  relationship with no surviving two-sided data in any export. This must be
  carried as a standing blockquote warning on the chronology page.
- **Interior holes inside a "dense" stretch.** The stretch labelled dense
  (2015-11 → 2020-10) still contains **three fully-zero months** — 2016-06,
  2016-09, 2017-08 — and four near-zero ones (2016-02: 3 msgs, 2016-10: 2,
  2020-05: 15, 2020-10: 7). A coverage table that says "dense — near-daily"
  over that range is *overstating the record*. Name the interior zeros.
- **Zero-days inside a month you are about to read.** December 2015 carries
  12,146 messages but on only **18 of 31 days**. Dec 4–7 is a contiguous
  four-day hole; Dec 20–28 is a nine-day hole that swallows Christmas. Before
  reading a month, run `bin/annie-corpus days YYYY-MM` and write the missing
  days down. A reader who does not do this will narrate Christmas 2015 as
  something that did not happen.

**Never describe a month by its day-count when only some days carry traffic.**
"December 2015 is 12,000 messages across 31 days" is false; it is 12,146 across
18 days with 13 days absent.

---

## 3. Size the window

`bin/annie-corpus days YYYY-MM` prints per-day counts. Size a session by
messages, not by calendar span.

- **400–1,300 messages is one comfortable window** — typically one day in a
  dense stretch, or several days in a thin one.
- Read whole days. Never split a day across sessions; overnight bursts run past
  midnight and an event cut in half is an event misread.
- **Do not prioritise by volume.** 2015-11-29 carries 1,026 messages and yields
  15 events; 2015-11-28 carries 110 and yields 9. Volume tracks *affect*, not
  incident. A high-volume day is usually two people gushing; the events are
  often in the quiet days where something was actually arranged.

Then `bin/annie-corpus read FROM TO`, and **read the whole thing, top to
bottom, before writing anything.** Not skimmed for candidates. The reason is
that most events in this material are only visible in sequence — three lines
scattered over five hours that together place a person in a house.

---

## 4. What counts as an event

This is the entire skill. Everything else is bookkeeping.

### 4.1 The discrimination test

Before writing an entry, ask: **could someone who had not read this window have
written this line?** If yes, it is not earned and it does not go on the page.
"They were very much in love" fails. "Annie's first surviving message is hers,
18:47, and she abandoned her own birthday dinner to send it" passes.

Second test: **does it survive the removal of the affect?** On a 669-message
day, perhaps 600 messages are endearments, emoji and reassurance. They are
context, not content. What survives is what someone *did*, *arranged*,
*disclosed*, *concealed*, or *paid for*.

### 4.2 The five things that make an event

Record an entry when the window establishes one of these:

1. **A fixed date, time, place or identity** the wiki lacks or has wrong.
   *"has to give y one more happy bday"* (2015-11-28 23:50) fixes Annie's
   birthday as November 28. *"I'm on 3 tee"* (01:57) fixes the meeting location.
2. **A first instance of a pattern later material makes central.** The
   concealment-as-reassurance move — *"Alexis doesn't know that you have any
   part in this… So you don't need to worry"* (11-28 19:01) — is the earliest
   instance in 97,768 messages of a shape the terminal-phase record runs on.
3. **An action, not a feeling.** A key confiscated. A car offered. A laptop
   taken back. A person removed from a house through a third party. Feelings
   are the medium; actions are the record.
4. **A mechanism — *how* something was accomplished.** The eviction is the
   model case: key confiscated (11-28) → property removed from the guest
   bedroom *"so she knows I could actually call the cops"* (11-30 00:35) →
   parents summoned (11-30 13:42) → a mother's 1pm inspection set as the
   deadline (12-01 09:27) → completion at noon. Each step reversible, none a
   scene. The mechanism is the finding; the completion date is trivia.
5. **An absence with an address.** *"Whenever you wake up, you have love
   letters in your inbox"* (11-30 06:51) establishes that the most deliberate
   writing of the first week went through an **email channel the message archive
   does not contain**. A named, chaseable gap is a first-class event. A vague
   one ("we probably don't have everything") is not.

### 4.3 What is not an event

- A sentiment, however intense or however many times repeated.
- A plan that is never executed and never referred to again.
- A restatement of something already on the page. **An event is recorded once,
  at its earliest instance**; later occurrences go to the motif tracker (§6.3),
  not back onto the chronology.
- Anything you inferred from other wiki pages rather than from this window.
  That is a *connection*, and it belongs in the entry's prose, explicitly
  marked — never in the headline.

### 4.4 Events span messages, and often span hours

The golf-course meeting is six messages over forty minutes plus a confirming
line thirteen hours later. The Alexis assault is four messages at 05:04–05:06
plus a retelling at 12:14. **Do not look for the message that "is" the event.**
Look for the set of lines that together make it undeniable, and cite them all.

---

## 5. Writing the chronology entry

### 5.1 Anatomy

```
**YYYY-MM-DD[, HH:MM or HH:MM–HH:MM] — <the finding, stated as a claim>.**
<Verbatim quotes with timestamps, in sequence.> <What they establish, and why
it matters.> <Any correction to an existing page, with a [[wikilink]].>
```

The headline is a **claim, not a label.** "Suz supplies cocaine and offers a
car, conditional on evicting Alexis" — not "Suz visit". If the headline could
head a different day's entry, it is too vague.

### 5.2 Quote discipline — non-negotiable

- **Quotes are exact.** Typos, missing apostrophes, autocorrect wreckage and
  all: *"K I'm on gold course"* keeps the typo. Every one of the first pass's
  33 entries was checked against the corpus and all quoted strings matched
  character-for-character. Hold that standard; it is what makes the page usable
  as evidence.
- **Every quote carries `HH:MM`.** Every one.
- Consecutive messages from one speaker may be joined with ` / `.
- Elide inside a quote with `…`, never across speakers.
- Attribute when it is not obvious from the text who is speaking.

### 5.3 Mark every inference as an inference

This is the failure mode this skill most needs to prevent, because it is the
one the first pass actually committed. The entry for the golf-course meeting
ends: *"The location is the **3rd tee** of the Uniontown Country Club course."*
The corpus establishes *"I'm on 3 tee"* and *"meet you on the golf"*. **It does
not name the club anywhere in the window.** The club identity is imported from
other knowledge and stated as flat fact.

The page's own method note promises "where a reading is uncertain it says so."
Keep that promise mechanically:

- Sourced by this window → state it plainly.
- Inferred from another wiki page → say so and link it: *"the course is
  presumably Uniontown CC, per [[wiki/interests/golf]] — not named in this
  window."*
- Genuinely ambiguous → *"reading uncertain"*, and put it in Open Leads.

An unmarked inference is worse than a gap, because the next reader cannot tell
it apart from evidence.

### 5.4 Where the entry contradicts the wiki, say so on the spot

A read pass earns its cost mainly through corrections. Three from the first
pass:

- The dossiers quote *"I met someone that instantly changed my life"* with no
  address. The corpus shows it said **to Annie**, 2015-11-29 03:28, an hour
  after the first meeting — and that the substantive follow-on (*"And I was
  alright with that for so long that I forgot I was sad"*) was never quoted.
- *"YOU ARE MY EVERYTHING"* is dated "day two/three" by the period page. It is
  2015-11-29 **03:24**, hours after the first meeting.
- Every existing account treats Annie as unattached at the switch. She was not:
  *"my fam and dude are here"* (01:35), *"turd boy"* (02:49), **"I am going to
  get rid of him just like you just did"** (02:52). **The switch was mutual and
  simultaneous.**

Write the correction into the entry, link the page it corrects, and queue it in
the notes page's corrections table (§6.4). Do **not** silently fix the other
page mid-read — that is a separate pass, and losing your place in the corpus to
do it is how a read dies.

---

## 6. The second output — the working-notes page

**Reading is the expensive step and it is paid once.** Pulling a second kind of
finding out of a window you have already read costs almost nothing. Re-reading
97,768 messages to recover something you noticed and did not write down costs
the entire pass again. A read that records only *events* therefore discards, at
the moment of maximum information, everything that is not an event.

So every pass writes **both** pages, **in the same session**. Notes captured
after the fact are notes not captured.

Five sections, all updated every pass:

### 6.1 Entity ledger
Every named person, place, animal or thing at **first appearance**, with what
the corpus itself says about it, and a status: `→ wiki/path` if a page exists,
**no page** if it is a candidate. This is how you discover that "Shu",
"Andre" and "Morgantown homeboy" exist at all.

### 6.2 Open leads
Chaseable questions, each **a specific thing to look for, not a topic.**
Good: *"Dan's 'love letters' go to an inbox, not by text (11-30 06:51). Look:
`gmail_bodies.txt` and any Gmail export, late Nov 2015."* Bad: *"investigate
email."* Number them so later passes can close them by number.

### 6.3 Motif tracker
Patterns with **dated instances**, recorded now so a later synthesis can count
them instead of re-reading. Each motif gets an ID (M1, M2 …), a one-line
statement, and a growing list of dated instances. When a later window repeats a
motif, you add an instance — you do not add a chronology entry.

### 6.4 Corrections queue
A table: page · standing claim · what the read shows. Mark each **applied** or
**not yet applied**. This is the handoff to the pass that fixes the other pages.

### 6.5 Quantitative markers
Counts worth having but not worth computing yet, plus hard anchors — first
"I love you" and its timestamp, sleep-cycle observations, initiation ratios.
**Compute these from the corpus, not from memory** (see §8.3).

---

## 7. Bookkeeping — the resume contract

A read spanning many sessions dies at the handoff unless every pass leaves:

1. **A progress table row** — read-through date · messages read · % of total ·
   events recorded. After the first pass: `2015-11-30 | 1,539 | 1.6% | 33`.
2. **An explicit resume pointer** — the literal next command:
   `bin/annie-corpus read 2015-12-01`.
3. **A sizing note for the next window** — what `days` says about it, and any
   zero-days inside it.
4. **A rate note** — what this pass cost and yielded, so the next reader can
   plan. Include the honest warning that early-relationship density is not
   representative.

### 7.1 The counts must reconcile — this is a real defect, not a nicety

The first pass's progress table claims **34 events**; the page body contains
**33** (9 on 11-28, 15 on 11-29, 9 on 11-30). Its rate note claims *"two days
of reading produced 25 events"*; those two days carry **24**. A consistent
off-by-one in both places, most likely from an entry merged or dropped without
updating the counters.

It is a small error that does exactly the wrong thing: the progress table is the
one part of the page a future reader *trusts without checking*, because
re-deriving it means re-reading. **Recount from the page body before writing the
number**, every time:

```bash
grep -c '^\*\*[0-9]\{4\}-[0-9]\{2\}-[0-9]\{2\}' wiki/timeline/annie-record.md
```

And re-derive "messages read" from the corpus rather than adding up remembered
per-day counts.

---

## 8. Verification gate — run before every commit

### 8.1 Every quoted string exists, verbatim
For each new entry, confirm the quote appears in the window you read. Batch this
carefully: `grep -hc` over several files at once **misreports which file a match
came from**. Check one file at a time, or you will "verify" a quote onto the
wrong day.

### 8.2 Every quote is on the day it is filed under
Attribution drift is the easiest error to make and the hardest to see later.
The first pass survives this check — 15/15 spot-checked quotes landed on
exactly their stated day, including cross-day cases like Suz's phone call,
where the *messages* are 11-30 13:48–13:49 and the *call* they describe is the
night of 11-29 (*"My mom called me last night after she left"*). When an entry
dates an event earlier than the messages that report it, say which is which.

### 8.3 Every derived number is re-derived, not remembered
The notes page states: *"Both parties' 'I love you' appears within 32 hours of
the first in-person meeting (Dan 03:14, Annie 03:14, 2015-11-29)"* — and calls
it *"a hard date for any later claim about escalation speed."*

Checked against the corpus, **both halves are wrong**. Annie's first is
**02:47** (*"Babe I love you"*), not 03:14 — 27 minutes before Dan's. And the
meeting is 01:52–~02:30 **the same night**, so the interval is **under twenty
minutes**, not 32 hours. The claim understates its own finding by two orders of
magnitude, and it was explicitly flagged as load-bearing for later work.

Any number offered as an anchor gets recomputed from `exports/annie-corpus.csv`
at the moment it is written down.

### 8.4 Both pages moved in the same commit
If the chronology changed and the notes page did not, the pass is incomplete.

### 8.5 Repo gates
`bin/wiki-lint && bin/wiki-connect check && bin/wiki-climb check` at 0 errors;
then `bin/wiki-digest && bin/llm-publish`. Append to `log.md` as **findings, not
activity** — what was wrong, what the evidence was, what changed. Commit as
`ingest: <what the window established>`.

---

## 9. Frontmatter

Both pages: `domain: timeline`, `status: active`, **`knowledge: earned`** — this
is reasoning done once and must never be regenerated from scratch, only revised
(`CLAUDE.md`, "why this is a second brain, not a RAG"). Chronology is
`page_type: chronology`; notes are `page_type: reference`. List every export in
`sources:`. Wire them to each other and outward with typed `connections:` per
`CONNECTIONS_SPEC.md`.

## 9.5 Data Locations

The Annie Read project stores data in **two repos with a strict hierarchy**:

### caakehorn/wiki-brain (PRIMARY — source of truth)
- **Local clone:** `/Users/daniel/wiki-brain`
- **Record:** `wiki/timeline/annie-record.md` — markdown, not JSON-wrapped
- **Notes:** `wiki/timeline/annie-read-notes.md` — markdown
- **Raw exports:** `raw/self/message-csv/`
- **LLM_HANDOFF.md:** resume point and session log
- **queue.md:** ingest queue

### caakehorn/home (DERIVED — do not edit directly)
- **Local clone:** `/tmp/homeclone`
- **Record:** `public/wiki/pages/timeline__annie-record.json` — JSON-wrapped, update `body` field
- **Notes:** `public/wiki/pages/timeline__annie-read-notes.json` — JSON-wrapped, update `body` field
- **URL:** https://caakehorn.github.io/home/brain/timeline/annie-record
- **Notes URL:** https://caakehorn.github.io/home/brain/timeline/annie-read-notes

**The home repo is derived from wiki-brain via `sync-wiki.yml`** (runs hourly and on dispatch). Edits to home's `public/wiki/` are overwritten by the sync. **Always edit wiki-brain first.** The home repo receives the content through the sync pipeline.

**Work in caakehorn/wiki-brain. Pages are wiki/**.md — edit those. Run bin/annie-corpus read FROM TO for the window, and update both wiki/timeline/annie-record.md and wiki/timeline/annie-read-notes.md in the same pass. Never edit public/wiki/** in caakehorn/home: it is a build artifact regenerated from this repo hourly, and anything written there is deleted within the hour.**

## 10. Known failure modes, in the order they actually occur

1. **Reaching for a script.** The instant the corpus feels too big, the urge is
   to grep for events. It produces garbage. Read a smaller window instead.
2. **Recording affect as incident.** Symptom: entries that would be true of any
   day. Apply §4.1.
3. **Unmarked inference.** Symptom: a specific proper noun that never appears in
   the window (§5.3).
4. **Count drift.** Symptom: the progress table disagrees with the body (§7.1).
5. **Remembered statistics.** Symptom: a clean-looking number nobody re-derived
   (§8.3).
6. **Treating a hole as a quiet period** (§2).
7. **Letting the notes page lag the chronology.** It is worthless the moment it
   is written from memory rather than from the open window (§6).
8. **Chasing a correction mid-read** and never returning to the corpus. Queue
   it; finish the window.
