  Full wipe-and-rewrite of one or more existing wiki/ pages in this repository —
  re-researching every claim from raw/ rather than editing the prose in place,
  then rebuilding the page's typed edges, index entries, downstream corrections
  and staleness cascade. Use this whenever the operator asks to rewrite, redo,
  wipe, rebuild, re-research, overhaul, "fully flesh out", or "start over on" a
  named page or set of pages, whenever they paste wiki page URLs or paths with
  an instruction to redo them, and whenever they say an existing entry is thin,
  stale, wrong, or shouldn't keep its current structure. Also use it when a page
  turns out to be about the wrong person or to rest on a false number and needs
  rebuilding rather than patching. This is the rewrite counterpart to
  INGEST_RUNBOOK.md, which governs ingesting new sources — reach for this one
  when the target is a page that already exists.

# Wiki rewrite — wipe, re-research, rebuild

## What this actually is

A wipe-and-rewrite reads like a formatting job and is not one. **It is a
re-derivation, and its product is the delta between what the page said and what
the corpus says.** Discarding the old headings is the permission you have been
given, not the goal. If you finish a rewrite and the page says the same things
in a nicer order, the pass failed — not because the prose got no better, but
because the reason the operator asked was that they suspected the page was
carrying something untrue, and you did not go and check.

That suspicion is usually right. In the reference pass (four pages, logged
2026-08-08), **every single page carried at least one false claim that one
well-aimed grep settled** — a wrong surname, a wrong date, a wrong message
count, a wrong book. None of those errors were visible from reading the page.
All of them were visible within about ninety seconds of opening `raw/`.

So the shape of the work is: inventory what the page asserts → go find out
whether each assertion is true → let what you find decide the new structure.

## Before you touch anything

Read, in this order: `CLAUDE.md`, `LLM_HANDOFF.md` (the current state and
resume points), `STYLE_GUIDE.md` (binding page format), `CONNECTIONS_SPEC.md`
(typed edges). If the pages you are rewriting carry `synthesizes:`, or anything
above them does, read `SYNTHESIS_SPEC.md` too. `MESSAGE_MINING.md` is required
reading before you count anything in the message corpus.

Then **snapshot what you are about to destroy**, because this is the failure
this repository has already had once and written down:

```bash
git show HEAD:wiki/<domain>/<page>.md > /tmp/claude-*/scratchpad/<page>.old.md
```

The 2026-08-02 `fran-coldren` rebuild dropped seven inverse edges other pages
were pointing at and silently deleted a standing `CONTRADICTION` block. The
edges were caught by a gate; the contradiction was caught only by luck on
re-read. Before writing the new page, extract from the old one:

- the full `connections:` block (other pages point at these; deleting an edge
  strands its inverse)
- every `> **CONTRADICTION:**` and `> **REVISED [date]:**` block
- any resolved-prediction or falsification record
- the `Gaps` list — the old page's honest unknowns are research leads, and in
  the reference pass one of them (`zach-harshman`'s doubt about its own
  surname) turned out to be the thread that unravelled the whole page

"Wipe" governs the prose and the heading structure. It does not govern earned
knowledge. A contradiction someone flagged in 2026-07 is a finding; carry it
forward, or explicitly resolve it and say so.

## Phase 1 — inventory

Two lists, both cheap, both worth writing down before you read any raw.

**What the page claims.** Walk the old page and pull out every checkable
assertion: dates, counts, names, spans, directions, ratios, attributions. These
are your research targets. Do not skim past the ones that look boring — "22
messages" and "~2012–2015" both looked boring and both were wrong.

**What points at it.** Inbound links tell you which other pages will break and,
more usefully, which other pages have been *relying* on the claim you are about
to test:

```bash
grep -rln "<page-slug>" wiki/ *.md
grep -rn -A2 "page: wiki/<domain>/<page-slug>" wiki/
```

The second command gives you the existing inverse edges with their claims. You
need these both to avoid stranding them and to know what type to pair when you
rewrite your own block.

## Phase 2 — re-research from raw

**Start wide, not from the page's own `sources:` list.** That list is a floor
and it was wrong on all four reference pages — it records what a previous pass
happened to read, not what exists.

```bash
grep -ril "<subject name>" raw/ | head -40
grep -ril "<alias>" raw/          # and every handle, nickname, maiden name
```

Then read what comes back. The mechanics of each source type — the message
dump's record format, how to walk a GEDCOM, how to strip the Facebook and
Google activity HTML, where contact identities live — are in
`references/corpus-recipes.md`. Read that file before writing greps against a
source type you have not handled before; several of these formats will silently
give you a wrong answer rather than no answer.

**Rank your sources, and say so on the page.** This repository's raw tree mixes
two very different kinds of evidence, and conflating them is how false claims
get laundered into the wiki:

- **Primary** — message dumps and per-thread CSVs, the GEDCOM, contact exports,
  Goodreads/YouTube/Twitter takeouts, Facebook message threads. These record
  what happened.
- **AI-secondary** — the Gemini sessions, `THE_DAN_FRANK_BOOTLOADER.md`,
  `CATO_*`, `DANSYNTH.txt`, the various profile dumps. These are a model
  reasoning about the corpus, often confidently and often wrong. They are
  genuine sources for *what Dan said and thought* — his own corrections inside
  a session are primary testimony — but their factual assertions are not
  evidence.

In the reference pass, a Gemini session had asserted a property deed lookup it
never showed, and the invented sale date had been sitting in the wiki as fact.
When you keep an AI-secondary claim, mark it as one on the page.

**Verify every derived number with the right instrument.** Message counts,
direction splits, date ranges and ratios are the figures the operator checks,
and naive `grep` on the message dump is quietly wrong for three separate
reasons documented in `MESSAGE_MINING.md`. Use `bin/mine-messages`:

```bash
bin/mine-messages grep '<pattern>' --from 2017-01-01 --to 2018-12-31
bin/mine-messages stats
```

This is not a formality. Writing this skill, a recount caught a per-day figure
in the freshly-written page that had been eyeballed off a grep — 28 messages
reported as 22. The instrument catches you; the eyeball does not.

Direction is the trap that produces the most confident wrong answers.
`MASTER_MESSAGES_DB_DUMP.csv` marks nearly everything `Received`, so any page
built from it reports one-sided threads. The old `zach-harshman` page said "22
messages, all received (export artifact)" — 22 was exactly the received count,
there was no export artifact, and Dan's own 19 messages were simply invisible to
the file the page was built from. **Any claim about what Dan said must come from
`all_imessages_complete_dump.txt`.**

**Resolve identity through the contact exports, not the page title.** If the
subject is a person, do this before you write a word — a page can be about the
wrong human and read perfectly. Cross-check `contacts.csv` against the Facebook
address book; agreement across two independent exports is a real
identification, and a single merged Google Contacts record is not. Recipe in
`references/corpus-recipes.md`.

**Follow proper nouns outward.** The highest-value findings in the reference
pass all came from chasing a name out of the subject's own material into
somewhere else: a brother's name into the family tree, a street name into a
third page, a nickname into an address book. Budget for this; it is where the
delta lives.

## Phase 3 — find the organizing principle

Before writing, answer in one sentence: **what is this page actually about, now
that you know what you know?** The new structure comes from that sentence.

This is the step that makes the rewrite worth the tokens, and it is the one that
gets skipped. Worked examples from the reference pass:

- A novelist page reorganised from "here is a remarkable coincidence" to **"here
  is the correction record"** — because the coincidence was already written down
  three times and what nobody had was the four rounds of the operator killing a
  confident model's hypotheses, which is the thing the page is actually evidence
  of.
- A house page reorganised from a list of things that happened there to **"the
  family's return terminus, and the eight months it belonged to someone else"** —
  because the GEDCOM supplied an arrival and the message corpus supplied an
  afterlife, and neither was on the page.
- A person page reorganised around **"a misattribution corrected"** — because the
  identity finding was larger than anything in the subject's own record.

If you cannot write that sentence, you have not finished Phase 2.

## Phase 4 — write

Follow `STYLE_GUIDE.md`; it binds. The points that matter most under a rewrite:

- **The first paragraph answers the stranger's question** — who this is to Dan,
  what state the relationship is in, what one thing defines it. Corpus
  statistics go last.
- **Consequence order, not chronology or ingest order.**
- **Say the load-bearing thing plainly.** If the research supports "this page was
  about the wrong person," write that sentence in the lead.
- **Longer is the standing preference.** Lint's 8 KB warning is advisory. Never
  trim earned content to clear it.
- **Tables hold numbers, prose holds meaning** — and never narrate a table.
- **Corrections are flagged, not silently applied.** A rewrite that fixes a
  false claim writes `> **CORRECTED [date]:**` or `> **REVISED [date]:**` with
  the old claim visible and the evidence that killed it. This is the single most
  valuable artifact the pass produces: a future reader needs to know the wiki
  *was* wrong here, or they will re-derive the error from the same bad source.
- **Gaps are content.** Name what you could not settle, including anything you
  deliberately left as an open `CONTRADICTION`.

## Phase 5 — wire it back

A rewritten page is not finished until the graph agrees with it.

1. **Write the new `connections:` block** — typed edges, argued one-sentence
   claims, per `CONNECTIONS_SPEC.md`. Aim for 3–10.
2. **Add the inverse on every target.** Pair the types correctly
   (`evidences`/`evidenced-by`, `instantiates`/`instance-of`,
   `component-of`/`contains`, `causes`/`caused-by`, `precedes`/`follows`;
   `contradicts`/`parallels`/`mirrors`/`co-occurs` are symmetric;
   `contextualizes`/`escalates`/`resolves` need no inverse). A mismatched pair
   warns on both sides and transmits nothing.
3. **Prose the load-bearing edges.** `causes`, `contradicts`, `instantiates` and
   `parallels` must be argued in the body of at least one of the two pages.
4. **Diff old edges against new.** Anything you dropped has a stranded inverse —
   either restore the edge or remove the inverse deliberately.
5. **Update the domain index** and any hub page whose one-line summary is now
   wrong.
6. **Propagate corrections downstream.** If the page was wrong, other pages
   probably repeat the error. In the reference pass a false claim about two
   five-starred books had already spread to `books.md`; it was corrected there
   in the same commit. Grep for the wrong fact, not just the page name.

If the identity changed, the page gets renamed: `git rm` the old file, create
the new slug, sweep every inbound link, fix the index entry, and check the
generated `llm/pages/**` path turns over. Say plainly in the log why the old
name was wrong.

## Phase 6 — the staleness cascade

Rewriting a page makes every page that declares it under `synthesizes:` stale,
and clearing those makes *their* dependents stale. Expect two rounds; the
reference pass had exactly two.

```bash
bin/wiki-climb check
```

**Bumping `date_modified` to silence a staleness warning is the one prohibited
move in this system.** Re-read what actually changed in the premise, decide
whether the conclusion survives, and record the decision on the page as a
`> **RE-CHECKED [date]:**` block — including when the answer is "survives
unchanged," which is a real result and takes two sentences.

Treat these re-checks as findings rather than paperwork. In the reference pass
they produced two: a synthesis about retention gained a boundary (the retention
is *asymmetric* — the other party had not kept Dan's number), and another had
two of its own named gaps moved by newly-read primary evidence. Both are things
no one would have gone looking for.

## Phase 7 — ship

All three gates at **0 errors** before committing; warnings are acceptable and
size warnings are advisory:

```bash
bin/wiki-lint && bin/wiki-connect check && bin/wiki-climb check
```

Then regenerate the committed artifacts, which the repo expects to track content:

```bash
bin/wiki-digest && bin/llm-publish
```

Then the record. `log.md` gets an append-only entry headed
`## [YYYY-MM-DD] rewrite | <domain> | <what>`, written as findings rather than
activity — what was wrong, what the evidence was, what changed. `LLM_HANDOFF.md`
gets a new session entry at the top with gates, findings in order of value, and
resume points; leave the older entries untouched, they are history.

Commit with `<op>: <short description>`, push with `git push -u origin <branch>`,
open a **draft** PR describing the deltas rather than the file list.

## The failure modes, collected

Each of these has actually happened in this repository.

| Failure | What it looks like | Guard |
|---|---|---|
| Reformatting instead of re-deriving | new headings, same facts | inventory the claims in Phase 1 and check each |
| Trusting `sources:` | research stops at the declared list | `grep -ril` the whole of `raw/` first |
| Laundering AI-secondary as fact | a Gemini-invented date sitting in the wiki | rank sources; mark what is secondary |
| Naive grep on the message dump | miscounts, truncated messages, missed curly apostrophes | `bin/mine-messages`, and read `MESSAGE_MINING.md` |
| Trusting direction from the CSV | "all received (export artifact)" | direction only from `all_imessages_complete_dump.txt` |
| Identity by page title | a page about the wrong person | resolve through two independent contact exports |
| Regenerating over earned content | dropped inverse edges, deleted contradiction blocks | snapshot and extract before writing |
| Silent correction | the false claim vanishes with no trace | `CORRECTED`/`REVISED` block with the old claim visible |
| Orphaned downstream error | the page is fixed, the pages quoting it are not | grep the wrong fact across `wiki/` |
| Date-bumping a stale premise | `wiki-climb check` goes quiet, nothing was read | `RE-CHECKED` block, always |

## Worked example

The four-page pass of 2026-08-08 — `jacob-bacharach`, `117-belmont-circle`,
`zach-harshman`→`zach-clingan`, `alexis-armel` — is this protocol run end to
end, including the rename, the downstream correction and the two-round staleness
cascade. The findings and the reasoning are in `log.md` under that date, and the
session summary is at the top of `LLM_HANDOFF.md`. Read them when you want to
see what the delta is supposed to look like.
