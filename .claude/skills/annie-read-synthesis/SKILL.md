# Annie Read — Synthesis & Spread

Step 1 (`forensic-message-analysis`) reads a window and writes two pages.
This skill is step 2: it takes what those two pages now say and makes the rest
of the wiki carry it.

A read batch that stays on `annie-record.md` has been discovered once. This
skill is how it gets discovered permanently.

---

## 0. Non-negotiables — read before anything

**Repository.** All work happens in `~/wiki-brain`. Pages are `wiki/**.md`.

**Never touch `caakehorn/home`.** Its `public/wiki/**` is a build artifact
regenerated from `wiki-brain` hourly; anything written there is deleted within
the hour, *including changes that merged*. If you are editing a page as JSON,
you are in the wrong repository — stop and re-orient.

**Never modify `raw/`.** It is the immutable source archive. No renames, no
`.bak` files, no deletions. If a file is in your way, work around it.

**Never `git add -A`.** Stage the exact files you changed, by path.

**Never work on `main`.** Branch first (§1).

**Do not read messages in this skill.** You are reasoning from `wiki/`, not
from `raw/`. If you find yourself opening a CSV, you have drifted into step 1.
The one exception is §4.4 (verifying a new number), which requires
`bin/annie-corpus` and says so explicitly.

**Do not ask the operator which findings to apply.** Apply everything that
passes §3. Bring back only the items §3 sends to HOLD.

---

## 1. Setup — exact commands, no searching

Do not run `find` over the home directory. The paths are known.

```bash
cd ~/wiki-brain
git checkout main && git pull origin main
git checkout -b annie-synthesis-<window>   # e.g. annie-synthesis-2015-12
ls wiki/timeline/annie-record.md wiki/timeline/annie-read-notes.md
```

If either file is missing or does not contain the window you are synthesizing,
**stop and report**. Do not reconstruct it from `caakehorn/home`.

Read in full, in this order:
1. `wiki/timeline/annie-record.md` — the events
2. `wiki/timeline/annie-read-notes.md` — ledger, open leads, motifs, corrections queue
3. `CONNECTIONS_SPEC.md` and `SYNTHESIS_SPEC.md` — you will be held to both

---

## 2. Build the evidence table — before you write anything

This is the gate that everything else passes through. Produce it first, as a
file, and keep it open.

For every candidate finding in the batch, one row:

| # | Claim (one sentence) | Verbatim quote that establishes it | Date + time | Speaker | Target page(s) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

**The quote must be copy-pasted from `annie-record.md`, not remembered.**
Open the page, find the line, paste it. If you are typing a quote from memory
you are fabricating it.

### Cite-or-cut

A row with no verbatim quote does not become a wiki edit. It becomes either:
- an **open lead** in `annie-read-notes.md`, or
- nothing.

There is no third option. "The read shows…" is not evidence; the quote is.

### The four disqualifiers

Cut any row where:

1. **The quote does not contain the claim.** If the claim is "Suz supplied the
   cocaine" and the quote is Dan saying *"It was my money"*, the row is cut.
2. **The claim names someone the quote does not name.** An unnamed person in
   the record stays unnamed. Identity is established by two independent
   references, not by one plausible match.
3. **The date cited is outside the corpus.** The corpus opens **2015-11-28**.
   Any cross-reference to an earlier date is fabricated unless it cites a
   `raw/` file.
4. **Two people share a first name.** Check the entity ledger before
   attributing anything to a bare first name.

### Already known wrong — do not reintroduce

These were asserted in earlier passes and are false on the record's own text:

- **"turd boy" is not established as Emilio.** On 2015-11-29 the man is
  unnamed; Emilio first appears 2015-12-02. This remains an **open lead**, and
  closing it by inference corrupts `bond-switch-2015`.
- **The Dec 29 $200 is Dan's own money.** Annie: *"that $200 wasn't even your
  own"*; Dan: *"It was my money."* It is not a Suz supply event. (The ~$120
  from Suz on Dec 31 is separate and is real.)
- **The Dec 9 "I have to talk to you" texts are Zach Clingan, not Zachariah
  Harshman.** Two different people.
- **`zgurd` is not whiskey.** It is bought from Suz in quantity and is the
  subject of the "stay away from coca" plan. If you cannot establish what a
   slang term means, put it in the ledger as unresolved — do not gloss it.

---

## 3. Disposition — every surviving row goes to exactly one place

Decide per row. Write the disposition into the table.

**EDGE** — the finding changes how two existing pages relate, but adds no new
prose. → §4.1

**SECTION** — the finding is a story an existing page should tell and
currently doesn't. → §4.2

**GROUND** — the finding is about an entity/event/place with no page. → §4.3

**CLIMB** — the same shape now appears on 3+ ground pages. → §4.4

**HOLD** — real, quotable, but its meaning depends on something you cannot
settle. Write it to `annie-read-notes.md` open leads and report it to the
operator at the end. Do not guess to clear a HOLD.

Two rules on this step:

- A finding that only restates what a page already says is **not** a finding.
  Drop it.
- If a cluster resists synthesis, **say so in `synthesis-queue.md` with a line
  of reasoning.** A cluster that won't climb is knowledge. Never write a page
  whose thesis is "these things are related."

---

## 4. Apply

### 4.1 EDGE — typed connections

Edges go in frontmatter, both directions. Vocabulary is closed
(`CONNECTIONS_SPEC.md`) — invent nothing.

Directional pairs: `causes`/`caused-by`, `evidences`/`evidenced-by`,
`instantiates`/`instance-of`, `precedes`/`follows`, `supplies`/`supplied-by`,
`component-of`/`contains`.
Symmetric: `contradicts`, `parallels`, `mirrors`, `co-occurs`.
No inverse needed: `escalates`, `resolves`, `contextualizes`.

```yaml
connections:
  - page: wiki/timeline/annie-record
    type: evidenced-by
    claim: "Suz arrives at 5 AM on 2015-11-30 with a line of cocaine and an offer of a car conditional on evicting Alexis — the family did not merely approve the switch, it brokered it and paid."
```

**The claim must transmit the finding, not point at it.** Test: a reader who
lands on this page and reads only the `connections:` block should come away
with the conclusion.

```yaml
# fails — names a relationship, transmits nothing
claim: "This page relates to the 2015 Annie read."

# passes — readable cold
claim: "Dan names procurement as the reason Alexis cannot leave (2015-11-29, 'she doesn't have another drug source'), which is the earliest instance in the corpus of the supply mechanism, applied to the departing partner."
```

Choosing `co-occurs` where the evidence supports `causes` is a substance
failure; choosing `causes` where it only supports `co-occurs` is a provenance
failure. **The type is the analytical commitment.**

Any `causes`, `contradicts`, `instantiates` or `parallels` edge must **also**
be argued in body prose on at least one of the two pages, with the wikilink
inside the argument — not in a list. `## Related` / `## See also` footers are
banned.

### 4.2 SECTION — sub-headers on existing pages

This is the "double-click" work: a thread from the read that an existing page
should now tell properly.

- **Integrate where it belongs in the existing argument.** Do not append a
  dated "new information" section at the bottom — that is how pages rot into
  changelogs.
- **Order by consequence, not chronology.** If the Dec 2 family confrontation
  is the defining event of Annie's first month, it goes near the top of the
  relevant section, not in row 14 of a table.
- **Write long.** The standing directive is longer, denser, more exhaustive.
  No page has yet been too long. The 40 KB lint warning is advisory and means
  "check navigation," never "shorten."
- Every quoted line keeps its **date and time**. Header time and body quotes
  must agree — if the header says `~13:05` and the quotes are 17:53, the
  header is wrong.
- Corrections to existing claims use a flagged block, never a silent edit:

```markdown
> **CORRECTED [2026-08-17]:** This page previously placed "YOU ARE MY
> EVERYTHING" on "day two/three." The read dates it to 2015-11-29 03:24 —
> hours after the first in-person meeting, in the same overnight burst.
```

Bump `date_modified` on every page you touch.

### 4.3 GROUND — new pages

**Before creating a people page, grep for the person under every known name,
alias and handle.** One page per entity. Merge, never fork.

Required frontmatter, in this order — a page without it is a **hard
`bin/wiki-lint` error**:

```yaml
---
domain: people
page_type: entity
status: stub
date_created: 2026-08-17
date_modified: 2026-08-17
sources:
  - exports/annie-corpus.csv
tags: [relationships, family]
connections:
  - page: wiki/timeline/annie-record
    type: evidenced-by
    claim: "<the finding, stated>"
infobox:
  name: Ellen Ulmer
  relationship_to_dan: "Annie's mother"
  known_for: "<one line>"
---

# Ellen Ulmer
```

`domain: people` pages **must** carry `infobox:` with at least `name` and
`relationship_to_dan` or lint errors. `tags` come from the closed set in
`STYLE_GUIDE.md` — do not invent one.

First paragraph answers the stranger's question: who is this to Dan, what is
the state of it, what one thing defines it. **Corpus statistics come last.**

A `status: stub` a later pass deepens beats a fact that lives nowhere.

### 4.4 CLIMB — new synthesis pages

Only when the same shape appears on **3+ ground pages**. Do not climb to raise
a number: three thin pages stacked make one thin page.

```yaml
page_type: synthesis
knowledge: earned
synthesizes:
  - wiki/people/annie-ulmer
  - wiki/people/suzanne-frank
  - wiki/timeline/annie-record
```

`sources:` is `raw/` paths only. `synthesizes:` is `wiki/` paths only. Crossing
them is a `bin/wiki-climb check` error.

Requirements: thesis in the first two sentences, the controls that carry it,
**at least one prediction**, and a Gaps section.

**Any new number must be verified against raw** — reasoning from pages does not
license inventing figures. Use `bin/annie-corpus` and cite the file in
`sources:`.

**Then wire it both ways.** Every page in `synthesizes:` gets an `instantiates`
edge back, whose claim states what that page turned out to be evidence *of* —
plus a prose sentence wherever the finding is load-bearing for that member. A
synthesis whose members don't carry it back is half-built, and is the most
common way good synthesis work fails to compound.

### 4.5 Where the work plan goes

A document about *what should be done* — "what gets linked, what needs a new
page" — is **not** a wiki page. `wiki/` is accumulated understanding about
Dan; a plan filed there gets indexed, mapped, word-counted and rendered as if
it were biography.

Plans go in `synthesis-queue.md` or `BACKLOG.md`. Both already exist.

---

## 5. Update the two read pages

The batch's own pages move too:

- **`annie-read-notes.md`** — mark each applied correction `applied` with the
  date. Add every HOLD as an open lead. Add any slang term you could not
  resolve to the ledger as unresolved.
- **`annie-record.md`** — add the `[[wiki/…]]` cross-links the new edges imply.
  The record is described in its own frontmatter as *"the evidentiary floor the
  Annie page's claims are supposed to rest on."* An entry with no outbound link
  cannot be reached from the pages it is supposed to support.

---

## 6. Exit checklist — all of it, in order

Nothing is done until every line passes.

```bash
cd ~/wiki-brain
bin/wiki-lint && bin/wiki-connect check && bin/wiki-climb check   # ALL at 0 errors
bin/wiki-digest && bin/llm-publish
```

- [ ] All three gates report **0 errors**. Warnings are fine; errors are not.
      A "missing frontmatter" error means you skipped §4.3.
- [ ] `log.md` — appended as **findings, not activity**: what was wrong, what
      the evidence was, what changed.
- [ ] `LLM_HANDOFF.md` — new entry with what you did and the exact next focus.
      This file is read at the start of every session; if you don't update it,
      the next pass starts from a stale pointer.
- [ ] Staged **by path**, never `git add -A`.
- [ ] Committed on the branch from §1, not on `main`.
- [ ] **Pushed** — `git push -u origin <branch>`. A local commit is not a
      deliverable. Verify with `git log origin/<branch> -1`.
- [ ] PR opened against `wiki-brain`.

Then report to the operator:
1. What was applied — pages touched, edges added, sections written, pages created.
2. **Every HOLD**, with the quote and what would settle it.
3. Anything cut under §2, and which disqualifier it hit.

Report cuts and HOLDs plainly. A finding you declined to assert because the
quote didn't support it is the skill working, not a failure — and it is the
single most valuable thing you can hand back.
