# Context Core

**The authoritative behavioral spine.** All self-knowledge in the wiki defers to this synthesis and its raw source for documented facts. Facts tagged `[DOC]` are verified from the behavioral corpus (iMessage, Twitter, GPS, residence records); `[MEM]` marks lower-certainty session memory. The raw source (`CONTEXT_CORE_EXPANDED.md`) additionally contains LLM session configuration and engagement directives, which stay in raw/ — this page carries the knowledge, not the prompt machinery. Interpretive depth (engines, kernel metaphors) lives in [[wiki/mind/concepts/phenomenology-lens]] and is loaded deliberately, never ambiently.

---

## LLM Quick Brief

**For context injection:** Daniel Gillingham Frank ("Dan"), born November 1, 1988, Uniontown PA (age from DOB — do not carry a hardcoded number). Independent music producer (GRIPNOTIC alias, active) and AI-consulting/agent pipeline work. Democratic socialist, atheist, autistic (self-identified), Jewish heritage on the paternal line. INTP 5w4 sx/sp — Ti-dominant forensic analyst who treats every domain (relationships, politics, work, AI) through the same anomaly-detection lens. The failure mode is never ignorance; it is the diagnosis-to-behavior gap. Core unconscious axioms: *not exceptional = worthless; not vigilant = annihilated; love that doesn't cost everything isn't real; time = countdown.* The decade-long relationship with [[wiki/people/annie-ulmer]] took an involuntary closure June 1, 2026 and **reopened in early August 2026 — treat it as live, not historical**; contact, an in-person apology to Suz, and resumed sexual contact all fall between 2026-08-02 and 2026-08-09. Housing is in transition: 337 Saratoga **Drive** sold ~June 2026 ($465k, Suz's transaction); the documented landing place is [[wiki/legal/463-morgantown|463 Morgantown St]], occupied on no signed lease with no post-close financial plan on record. BFS termination (cash dispute) in 2026. The one consistently sincere output channel is music production. All behavioral data defers to the message corpus — **217,573 records, 106,629 sent / 110,944 received across 503 handles**, per `bin/mine-messages stats` — and to documented primary records, not memory or narrative.

> **STALENESS AUDIT [2026-08-16] — the spine had drifted fourteen days behind its
> own corpus, and the drift was concentrated in the one paragraph that gets
> injected into LLM sessions.**
>
> Ninety of 456 pages were modified after this page's 2026-08-02 revision. Seven
> claims here were superseded by that newer work. They are corrected in place
> above; each is recorded here rather than silently overwritten, per `CLAUDE.md`
> §3 — *never clear a stale warning by bumping a date.*
>
> | Claim as it stood | What moved it | Verdict |
> |---|---|---|
> | Annie "closed — not live" | [[wiki/people/annie-ulmer]] 2026-08-15: *"Live, not closed"*, three dated Aug 2026 events | **REVERSED** |
> | Tom "~16,563 msgs (rank 4)" | Handle `+13307038747` is [[wiki/people/kristin]]; [[wiki/self/message-corpora/master-message-dump]] flags the prior mislabel | **REASSIGNED** — Tom is ~5,763, rank #5 |
> | "337 Saratoga St", "no confirmed successor" | [[wiki/legal/463-morgantown]]; [[wiki/mind/synthesis/estate-money-spine]] ($465k, ~2026-06) | **CORRECTED + RESOLVED** |
> | "181,585-row message corpus" | [[wiki/self/message-corpora/source-coverage-index]] 2026-08-14 | **WRONG OBJECT** — that is one file, not the corpus |
> | "97,199 sent iMessages" | `bin/mine-messages` header: the dump that yields 97,199 marks nearly everything `Received` | **SUPERSEDED** by 106,629 |
> | Annie "126k+ msgs" | Four-handle merge = 97,768 unique (`LLM_HANDOFF` 2026-08-15) | **ROWS ≠ UNIQUE** |
> | Fran "age ~97–98" + open contradiction | [[wiki/people/fran-coldren]] resolved 2026-08-02 from a dated message | **CLOSED at 97** |
>
> **The Tom/Kristin one is the load-bearing error.** This page is cited by name as
> an authority — [[wiki/work/bfs-foods]] quotes it directly — so a person's corpus
> weight being overstated ~2.9× by absorbing somebody else's thread is the kind of
> mistake that gets reasoned *from*. Tom is the wiki's exhibit for safe lateral
> attachment; the volume behind that claim was mostly a different relationship.
>
> **Two failure classes worth naming, because both will recur.** First, *a number
> that is right about one file and wrong about the corpus* — 181,585 is a true row
> count and a false corpus size, and it had already propagated to six pages.
> Second, *a hardcoded age*: "Age 37 as of 2026" is true until 1 November and then
> silently false, with nothing to trip on it. Both are now expressed as
> derivations rather than constants.
>
> **What this audit could not settle.** The Annie status is corpus-derived and its
> last dated evidence is 2026-08-09; the 463 Morgantown move-in date, whether the
> Little Caesars transfer executed, and the current state of the Arnu lien are all
> unpinned in the record. They are marked as open above rather than guessed.

## Core identity

- **Name:** Daniel Gillingham Frank ("Dan") [DOC]
- **DOB:** 1988-11-01 [DOC]
- **Location:** Uniontown / Leith-Hatfield, Fayette County, SW PA (current); NYC as punk identity anchor [DOC]
- **Occupation:** Independent music producer + label; parallel AI-consulting / multi-agent pipeline work [DOC/MEM]
- **Politics:** Democratic socialist [DOC] · **Religion:** Atheist since 2007, raised Presbyterian [DOC] · **Heritage:** paternal line Jewish — load-bearing to politics [DOC/MEM]
- **Typology:** INTP · Enneagram 5w4 sx/sp · Attitudinal Psyche FLEV/VLEF · Socionics ILI-Ni [DOC for core; function percentages largely inferred]

**Cognitive stack** [DOC]: Ti-dominant (reality parsed as high-fidelity system, frameworks from first principles), Ne-auxiliary (cross-domain pattern recognition), Si-tertiary (high-fidelity archival recall), Fe-inferior (craves connection, distrusts emotional read). Methodology is domain-invariant "find where it breaks": hinge-instants over resolved states, anomaly detection as default. Metacognitive accuracy ~82nd percentile — the failure mode is never ignorance but the diagnosis-to-behavior gap. Self-deprecation sets the floor low so being right reads as surprise; the same mechanism that makes him updateable makes him chronically undersell competence. Threat model: "competence correctly deployed, outcome still catastrophic."

**Core axioms (unconscious, load-bearing)** [DOC]: not exceptional = worthless · not vigilant = annihilated · love that doesn't cost everything isn't real · time = countdown.

> **CORROBORATION ATTEMPTED [2026-08-02] — three of the four axioms are not
> visible in the message corpus, and *time = countdown* is the clearest
> negative.** The first systematic pass of the message-density campaign
> (`EXTRACTION_SPEC.md`) tested the axioms lexically against all 106,629 of Dan's
> outbound messages, 2015–2025, with the 110,944 inbound messages from 503 other
> handles as a within-medium control. Results, per thousand messages:
>
> | Prediction if *time = countdown* holds | Dan | Others | |
> |---|---|---|---|
> | "running out of time / no time left" | 0.01 | 0.03 | **0.35×** |
> | "deadline / last chance / now or never" | 0.09 | 0.23 | **0.42×** |
> | "before I die / turn / lose / run out" | 0.00 | 0.04 | **0.00×** |
> | "too late" | 0.47 | 0.25 | 1.86× |
>
> On every explicit urgency construction except one, Dan writes **less** of it
> than the people texting him. "Rest of my life" looked promising at 3.5× until
> the twenty hits were read: all of them are 2015–16 declarations to
> [[wiki/people/annie-ulmer|Annie]] — *"I want to spend the rest of my life with
> you"* — which is love-bombing, not mortality. Direct age self-reference
> survives contamination at **n=8** across eleven years, half of it escort-ad
> boilerplate.
>
> **This does not falsify the axiom, and the distinction matters.** An
> unconscious load-bearing axiom is not a thing anyone would expect to find
> people *typing*, and the control shows SMS is a near-zero-introspection medium
> for everybody in it — "the thing about me" occurs zero times in 217,573
> messages from either direction. What the result establishes is narrower and
> more useful: **the message corpus cannot corroborate the axioms, so the
> corpus's standing as final arbiter has a jurisdiction.** The LLM Quick Brief
> above says all behavioural data defers to the message corpus. For behaviour
> that is true. For the psychological layer the corpus is silent, and every
> axiom on this line rests on the AI-session dossiers alone
> ([[wiki/mind/synthesis/ai-collaborative-analysis]]) — which is a thinner
> evidentiary base than the wiki's confidence in them has so far implied.
>
> One axiom did draw independent support, from behaviour rather than vocabulary:
> see [[wiki/mind/concepts/calibrated-confidence]] for a Ti-dominance signature
> measured at 22× the corpus baseline.

> **METHOD NOTE — a false positive caught in the same pass, recorded because the
> next reader will hit it too.** The first run of this test scored "age
> self-reference" at 3.82× baseline and very nearly became a finding about the
> countdown being experienced as *position rather than urgency*. Reading the
> matches showed the pattern was catching **"I'm 99% sure"** — percentages, not
> ages. The apparent countdown signal was Dan's probability habit wearing an age
> pattern's clothes. Any future lexical pass over this corpus should read its
> matches before believing its counts.

## Psychometrics [DOC]

| Instrument | Highs | Lows |
|-----------|-------|------|
| Big30 | Impulsiveness 96 · Intellect 95 · Liberalism 91 · Self-Consciousness 91 · Introspection 87 · Artistic Interests 81 · Vulnerability 78 · Anxiety 67 | Altruism 1 · Submissiveness 1 · Sociability 3 · Modesty 5 · Assertiveness 5 · Sympathy 6 · Trust 9 |
| PD profile | Schizotypal 79 · Narcissistic 67 · Antisocial 58 | |
| Deviance | Cognitive 98 · Linguistic 97 | |

Read the low-sociability / low-trust / low-altruism scores as architecture, not deficit to fix.

## Chemical architecture [MEM/DOC]

Engineered neurochemical system, instrumental with tradeoffs; the recovery model is explicitly rejected. Suboxone: daily chassis since **Feb 17, 2010** (day-zero confirmed; earlier entries saying ~Jan 2010 were corrected) — **16+ years as of 2026** (compute from the day-zero date rather than carrying a frozen figure), zero relapse, the residual 1% opiate glow intentional. Cocaine: cognitive accelerant, daily, framed as tool. Nicotine: ritual regulator; weed daily. Alcohol: zero for 13–15 years, active aversion — family pattern heavily implicated in prior conflicts.

## Voice [DOC]

Two independent corpora confirm one stable voice: **106,629 sent iMessages (2015–2025)** and the @danfrank Twitter archive (2009–2024). The lowercase/fragment/ellipsis idiom is present in 2009 tweets — stable architecture, not platform artifact.

| Marker | Count / Value |
|--------|---------------|
| Burst cadence | 8.36 words/message avg, 3–7 discrete bursts |
| Lowercase share | 80%+ |
| ALL-CAPS instances (vocal emphasis) | 9,282 |
| Ellipsis `...` (breath mid-burst) | 1,661 |
| Unique words | 23,286 (95th-percentile lexical diversity) |
| `just` / `like` / `even` | 6,847 / 5,522 / 1,971 |
| `fucking` (intensifier) | 1,745 |
| `because` (justification compulsion) | 2,465 |
| `i don't` / `i'm not` (identity-by-negation) | 1,845 / 814 |

Pivot words `actually` / `honestly` / `literally` mark the turn from cynical observation to vulnerable truth. Generation formula: 3–7 lowercase bursts, one ALL-CAPS word at the emotional peak, seeded ambient modifiers, ending on a probe.

## Social graph

| Person | Role | Corpus weight |
|--------|------|---------------|
| [[wiki/people/tom]] (Tom Maison) | Primary male ally, safe attachment, first-call for major events; drug supply line; Ohiopyle excursions; ~3 weeks older, Pittsburgh area | **4,160** (`+17249987341`) + ~1,603 (`phloxenheim@gmail.com`) ≈ **5,763; rank #5** |
| [[wiki/people/suzanne-frank]] (Suzanne Frank, mother) | Realtor, primary financial line, oscillates savior↔adversary; "Blue MAGA wine mom," functional alcoholic; selling 337 Saratoga Dr (June 2026) | High |
| [[wiki/people/jerad-friedline]] | Childhood friend (Sacramento); married, one daughter; e-commerce; political mirror; FSLY tip; "josh brannan is innocent.wav" last exchange | High (first-call) |
| [[wiki/people/annie-ulmer]] (Anne Ulmer) | Decade-defining relationship ~2015–2026, met via [[wiki/people/alexis-armel|Alexis]]; closed June 1, 2026 (group chat); defamation confirmed; [[wiki/people/eli|Eli]] affair central — the gaslighting outweighed the affair | **97,768 unique across four handles** (`7244346811`, `7249204125`, `2124702449`, `alulmer28@gmail.com`); the older "126k+" is a row count over overlapping exports, not unique messages |
| [[wiki/people/rick-frank]] (father) | Periodic low-intensity contact; undischarged paternal-authority wound | Low |
| Vanessa (sister) | Vail, ski school; minimal presence | Low |
| [[wiki/people/fran-coldren]] (great-grandmother) | b. 15 Aug 1920, d. 4 Apr 2018, **age 97**; self-described biggest life influence; dirt-poor WV → coal-baron marriage; gifted the Numark NS7; seven-day deathwatch with Annie | High |

Lower-resolution contacts with known gaps: Chris James. (The former "Ismaila" gap is resolved: Ismaila Barry = "DJ" of [[wiki/work/au-zaatar|Au Za'atar]] — [[wiki/people/ismaila-barry]].)

> **CONTRADICTION CLOSED [2026-08-16] — she was 97, and this page was the last copy still carrying the spread.**
> [[wiki/people/fran-coldren]] resolved it on 2026-08-02 against a dated message
> in which Dan describes her, at the time, as *"a 97 year old woman with advanced
> dimentia"* (2017-12-29) — consistent with an August 1920 birth and an April 2018
> death. The **98** in this page and in
> `raw/self/context-core/CONTEXT_CORE_EXPANDED.md`, and the "93-year-old
> matriarch" in an operator capture, are both superseded. Note the direction of
> travel: the raw spine was wrong and a dated primary message corrected it, which
> is the one case `CLAUDE.md` allows a non-raw source to outrank
> `CONTEXT_CORE_EXPANDED.md`.
>
> The Coldren / Whyel / Thomas naming is **not** a contradiction — three marriages,
> all three surnames canonical, all carried as aliases on her page.

## Residence timeline (canonical) [DOC/MEM]

| Period | Residence | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| 1988–1996 | Uniontown PA · 12 Bryer Ave | |
| 1996–Sep 2008 | Uniontown PA · 337 Saratoga Dr | Ski identity; Republican household. **Hinge Nov 2005:** parental rupture (father rehab + mother affair) |
| Sep 2008–Mar 2010 | Winter Park FL (Full Sail) | AS Recording Arts, top 5% (ceremony Oct 2, 2009); Pro Tools HD 7 certified Feb 2010; Suboxone day-zero Feb 17, 2010; Danielle ends, Alexis begins |
| Apr 2010–May 2013 | NYC — Brooklyn 424 Bedford → Manhattan UES | Studio-work era; Twitter voice weaponized |
| May 2013–Feb 2019 | Uniontown — 337 Saratoga → 155 Virginia Ave | SLOPPP (2013–14) → MOGZART (2014–16); Annie begins Thanksgiving 2015; poverty floor 2017, deep cycle 2018 |

| Feb 2025–~Jun 2026 | Uniontown PA · 337 Saratoga Drive | Returned Feb 22, 2025; Annie closure June 1, 2026; **house sold ~June 2026 ($465k)**; music reactivation, agent/AI work |
| ~Jun 2026–present | Uniontown PA · [[wiki/legal/463-morgantown|463 Morgantown St]] | Dan and Suz land here on no signed lease and no confirmed power of attorney; owner is [[wiki/people/alexander-jackson]]. **Occupancy documented, move-in date not fixed in the record** — the transition is described prospectively on the source page and no message or record yet pins the day. Annie reopens Aug 2026 |

NYC was two distinct chapters split by a six-year Uniontown stretch; the producer development and deep-cycle years happened in Uniontown.

## Current state (last re-derived 2026-08-16)

- **Annie: LIVE, not historical.** The June 1 2026 severance held 52 days and then
  broke. [[wiki/people/annie-ulmer]] (2026-08-15) states it outright — *"Live, not
  closed — contact resumed"* — on three dated events: **2026-08-02** Annie walks to
  the house and apologises to Suz in person; **2026-08-08** [[wiki/people/jerel-coles|Jerel Coles]]
  identified via FOREWARN at 19:01:22, five-hour collapse follows
  ([[wiki/timeline/events/august-2026-unmasking]]); **~2026-08-07/09** sexual contact
  resumes, breaking a stated six-month gap. [[wiki/mind/synthesis/dormancy-not-exit]]
  reaches the same conclusion independently. *Not operator-confirmed past 2026-08-09
  — the corpus is the source, and the last dated evidence is a week old.*
- **Housing:** 337 Saratoga Drive **sold** ~June 2026 ($465k, Suz's transaction as
  owner-realtor). Landing place is [[wiki/legal/463-morgantown|463 Morgantown St]] —
  no signed lease, no confirmed power of attorney, Suz in a mixed
  agent/tenant/caretaker role with no separation of liability. **Open exposure:** the
  [[wiki/people/arnu|Arnu]] mechanics lien was estimated to mature ~**27 July 2026**
  and [[wiki/mind/synthesis/estate-money-spine]] records the deadline as having
  *elapsed unobserved*. Whether any 337 proceeds are earmarked for Dan's housing is
  still undocumented.
- **Music:** the one sincere self-assembling thread; involuntary sub-bass signature (63–85% across 13 years, every alias); bottleneck is shipping.
- **Work exit:** BFS termination (cash-variance dispute — [[wiki/work/bfs-foods]]); Little Caesars transfer via Kim **planned, not confirmed executed** — no page records the transfer completing.

## Dan's Law, trauma nodes, gaps

**[[wiki/mind/concepts/dans-law]]** [DOC]: when a coincidence cluster requires every element to be simultaneously innocent and the joint probability is near zero, assume real signal — but treat one or two elements as parasitic noise; find the irreducible load-bearing element.

**Trauma nodes** [DOC]: parental rupture ~2004–05 (paternal-authority wound) · Alexis collapse 2009–2015 · Eli incident late 2024 (the central harm was the gaslighting).

**Known gaps:** the 2021–2022 near-silence in the corpus is uncharacterized; no sustained non-crisis baseline register has been captured.

## Political and intellectual profile

Trajectory [DOC]: Republican (parroted) → leaves 2006 → diffuse liberal → hard-left 2019 (Bernie + Chapo). Frame: democratic socialist, vertical-authority-skeptic, lateral-solidarity-privileging; politics as primary entertainment and near-total ideological pursuit. Settled positions: Israel ≠ Judaism, Zionism ≠ Judaism, anti-ethnostate, full Palestinian sovereignty — "everyone is in the wrong, then score who is *more* wrong." J6 is CONCLUDED as a hybrid organic event + intelligence co-opt, with the "tourist-wandering" behavioral signature as key evidentiary anchor ([[wiki/mind/synthesis/political-psyops]]). Intellectual spine: Majority Report, Chapo, ContraPoints, RLM, hbomberguy; Goodreads ~97.8% nonfiction; Roman Republic deep interest with a hard stop at Augustus; pays for Nate Silver.

## Shibboleths

Freezer phone (run over on Second Ave) · Wall of Despair (Tom's [[wiki/people/kristin|Kristin]] comment) · FSLY tip from Jerad · Acura Integra correction · "josh brannan is innocent" (sacred joke) · predicted Roe repeal May 2020 · invented "LOSE IT" fake service · OutKast "Chonkyfire" linked to Jerad's ex · Boomer (first cat).

## Notes

When in doubt, the documented counts, timelines, and primary records here override generated metaphor. The raw corpus behind this page: **217,573 message records** (106,629 sent / 110,944 received, 503 handles) in the direction-reliable dump, plus audio and listening/library data. **181,585 is not the corpus** — it is the row count of a single file, `imessage_ALL_both_all_now.csv`; see [[wiki/self/message-corpora/source-coverage-index]], which counts 52 sources and 1,786,124 rows against roughly 187,000 unique messages.
