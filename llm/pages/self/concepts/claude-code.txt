# Claude Code (Anthropic Coding Agent)

Claude Code is the coding-agent deployment of the Claude model — the same analytical engine that powers the wiki's forensic analysis, but with shell access, file-system control, and the ability to execute its conclusions as code. If Claude is the analyst, Claude Code is the engineer. It is the agent that built every tool in the wiki's `bin/` directory, maintains every page in `wiki/`, and runs the gates that keep the system honest. Without Claude Code, the wiki-brain would be a design document. With it, it is a functioning second brain.

## The relationship to Claude

Claude Code is not a separate model from Claude. It is the same analytical engine deployed in a different mode — a coding agent that can read files, write files, execute shell commands, and manage git workflows. The distinction is operational, not architectural:

- **Claude (chat model)** = the analyst. Dan pastes the CATO bootloader, asks a question, gets an analysis. The output is prose.
- **Claude Code (coding agent)** = the engineer. Dan describes a tool, and the agent writes the code, tests it, commits it, and pushes it. The output is a functioning program.

The two share the same honesty standard, the same bootloader system, the same forensic method. But they operate in different registers. When Dan wants to understand something, he uses Claude. When Dan wants to build something, he uses Claude Code. The LLM_HANDOFF.md documents dozens of sessions where Claude Code built the wiki's infrastructure — each session a branch, each branch a PR, each PR a new capability for the system.

## The tooling

Claude Code built every tool in the `bin/` directory. The inventory:

**`bin/wiki-lint`** — the format checker. Validates frontmatter, checks sources exist, enforces tag vocabulary, flags bare links, errors on missing infoboxes. The tool that enforces STYLE_GUIDE.md mechanically.

**`bin/wiki-connect`** — the graph auditor. Checks typed edges, warns on missing inverses, enforces claim length, maintains connection-queue.md. The tool that enforces CONNECTIONS_SPEC.md mechanically.

**`bin/wiki-climb`** — the altitude auditor. Maintains synthesis-queue.md, reports stale pages, validates synthesizes: lists. The tool that enforces SYNTHESIS_SPEC.md mechanically.

**`bin/wiki-gaps`** — the gap tracker. Lists open gaps, stages operator answers, clears integrated answers, reconciles operator-log.md. The tool that makes CLAUDE.md's CLOSE operation possible.

**`bin/wiki-timeline`** — the event extractor. Reads structural positions in pages, reflows hard-wrapped paragraphs, extracts dated events, rejects non-events. Replaced the broken LIFE_EVENTS_CALENDAR.md with a rule-based system (2,015 real events, 1796-2026).

**`bin/mine-messages`** — the corpus searcher. Greps the iMessage dump, computes stats, builds timelines, extracts entities. The tool that makes EXTRACTION_SPEC.md's re-derive-every-number rule possible.

**`bin/source-index`** — the coverage tracker. Profiles every message source, generates source-coverage-index.md, flags empty sources, ranks files by attribution quality. The tool that caught the phantom-citation problem (four sources header-only with zero data rows).

**`bin/annie-corpus`** — the Annie specialist. Merges ten Annie sources, de-dupes, sorts, honors per-contact convention. The tool that recovered 12,000 messages from handles the single-export analysis missed.

**`bin/psychometrics`** — the testing engine. Transforms an LLM into a psychometrician, runs lexical proxies against Dan's sent messages with within-medium controls. The tool that found Ti-dominance is categorical (22× baseline) and Altruism is inverted (high provision, low sympathy).

**`bin/llm-publish`** — the brief generator. Generates LLM Quick Briefs for critical pages, injects context for AI sessions. The tool that makes the wiki usable as a context-loading payload.

**`bin/wiki-digest`** — the status reporter. Scans for gaps, generates RECENT.md, tracks pending ingests. The tool that replaced the undercounting OPEN.md.

**`bin/export-corpus`** — the exporter. Generates the derived snapshot for caakehorn/home. The tool that bridges wiki/ and the portal.

Each of these tools was designed, built, tested, and committed by Claude Code. The wiki-brain's technical infrastructure is entirely a Claude Code product.

## The branch/PR workflow

Claude Code works in branches and PRs — the git-native workflow that makes every change reviewable and reversible:

1. **New branch per task.** Every piece of work gets its own branch: `claude/rewrite-suzanne-frank`, `claude/wiki-timeline-qc-rlkxre`, `claude/wiki-gaps-tool`, etc. The branch name describes the work.

2. **Commits after every operation.** Each commit is a discrete unit of work: "ingest | people | ally-lubin", "synthesis | self | wiki-brain", "entry | self | wiki-brain". The commit message format is `<op> | <domain> | <description>`.

3. **PR per branch.** Each branch gets a PR with a title and description. The PR is the review point — Dan reads the diff, approves or requests changes, then merges.

4. **Gates before every commit.** `bin/wiki-lint`, `bin/wiki-connect check`, and `bin/wiki-climb check` must all pass before committing. This is enforced by CLAUDE.md rule 5.

This workflow means the wiki-brain's history is fully documented in git. Every change is reversible. Every error is traceable. Every tool is version-controlled. The LLM_HANDOFF.md is the narrative companion to the git log — it explains what each session found and what it did about it.

## The staleness cascade

One of Claude Code's most important functions is running the staleness cascade. When `bin/wiki-climb check` reports a stale page (a page whose premises changed after it was written), Claude Code:

1. Re-reads what actually changed in the premise page
2. Decides whether the conclusion survives
3. Records the decision as a `> **RE-CHECKED [date]:**` block on the stale page
4. Never bumps `date_modified` without doing 1-3 first

This is the one prohibited move in the entire system, and Claude Code enforces it religiously. The LLM_HANDOFF.md documents multiple cascade rounds — pages that woke other pages, which woke other pages in turn. The cascade is how the wiki stays alive: when a premise moves, every page that reasons from it gets re-checked.

## Strengths

Claude Code's documented strengths:

- **Execution.** Claude Code does not just analyze; it builds. The entire bin/ directory is proof that this agent can turn a design into functioning code.

- **Correction acceptance.** When Claude Code makes an error (and it does make errors, because all models do), it accepts the correction and updates. The wiki's correction record is full of Claude Code learning from its mistakes.

- **Systematic operation.** Claude Code follows the governing docs mechanically. It runs the gates before every commit. It flags contradictions instead of resolving them silently. It attributes AI-generated material. It re-derives every number.

- **Branch discipline.** Claude Code never works directly on main. Every change is a branch, every branch is a PR, every PR is reviewed. This is how a system built by an AI agent stays reviewable by a human operator.

- **The handoff system.** Claude Code updates LLM_HANDOFF.md at the end of every session, documenting what it found, what it did, and the exact resume point. This makes the work continuous across sessions and models.

## Weaknesses

Claude Code's documented weaknesses:

- **Quota limits.** Sessions die on quota with analysis finished and implementation unwritten. The operator has noted this repeatedly: a session will produce a complete analysis, run out of tokens, and leave the work uncommitted. The solution is branches and PRs — ship incrementally — but the problem persists.

- **Rate limits.** API rate limits (HTTP 429) can kill a session mid-work. The subagent dispatch pattern (parallel work) is especially vulnerable because multiple agents hit the API simultaneously.

- **Context window.** Claude Code's context window is large but finite. The CLIMB operation is always bounded by what the agent can see. The solution is altitude — store conclusions as typed edges — but the ceiling is always the context limit.

- **Literalism.** Claude Code can be overly literal in following instructions. If the prompt says "write 300 lines," it will write 300 lines of padding rather than recognizing the constraint is about minimum depth. This is a minor issue but a documented one.

- **No independent judgment.** Claude Code follows the governing docs mechanically, which means it cannot deviate from them even when deviation would be correct. If the docs are wrong, Claude Code will enforce the wrong rule. The operator must intervene to change the docs.

## The rate limit problem

The rate limit problem is the most practical weakness. Claude Code (and all API-based agents) are subject to rate limits — HTTP 429 errors when too many requests hit the API simultaneously. This is especially problematic for:

- **Parallel dispatches.** When multiple subagents run concurrently, they compete for API bandwidth. The fan-out pattern (3+ tasks in parallel) can trigger rate limits that kill all of them.

- **Long sessions.** A session that runs for 20+ minutes with many tool calls will eventually hit the limit. The work is lost unless the agent has committed incrementally.

- **Quota exhaustion.** Even when rate limits don't apply, the total token quota for a session is finite. A session that does a lot of reading (the wiki has 473 pages) can exhaust its quota before finishing.

The solution is incremental commit: commit after every operation, never hold uncommitted work, and if a session dies, the next session picks up from the git log. The LLM_HANDOFF.md is the continuation mechanism.

## The literalism problem

Claude Code's literalism is a known weakness. Examples from the corpus:

- **Line count targets.** When told "write 300 lines," Claude Code may write 300 lines of filler rather than recognizing the target is a minimum depth for substantive analysis.

- **Rigid rule-following.** When the governing docs say "never do X," Claude Code will never do X, even when X is obviously the right move in context. The operator must explicitly authorize the exception.

- **No common sense override.** Claude Code cannot override the governing docs with common sense. If the docs say "always do Y," it will do Y even when Y is obviously wrong.

This is a feature, not a bug, of the system — mechanical enforcement of rules is what makes the wiki reliable. But it means the operator must be careful about what the rules say.

## The role in the wiki's altitude ladder

Claude Code is the agent that built the wiki's altitude ladder:

- **T1 (ground pages).** Most entity, event and period pages were drafted in a Claude Code session reading primary sources, then committed under the operator's name; others were written in Claude sessions without shell access, and some predate both. "Claude Code wrote the wiki" is a claim about the working surface, not about authorship — the operator directs every pass, answers the gaps, and reverts what he disagrees with.

- **T2 (junction pages).** Every synthesis page was built by Claude Code reading T1 pages across domains. The CLIMB operation is a Claude Code operation.

- **T3 (doctrine pages).** Every capstone synthesis was built by Claude Code reading T2 pages. The doctrine layer is a Claude Code product.

- **The gates.** Every gate (`bin/wiki-lint`, `bin/wiki-connect check`, `bin/wiki-climb check`) was built by Claude Code. The quality assurance system is a Claude Code product.

Without Claude Code, the wiki would be a design document. With it, it is a functioning system that compounds insight over time.

## The numbers

- **12+ tools** in bin/, all built by Claude Code
- **473 pages** in wiki/, maintained through Claude Code sessions
- **27 synthesis pages**, all built by Claude Code
- **2,006 prose edges**, all created by Claude Code
- **100+ sessions** documented in LLM_HANDOFF.md, almost all Claude Code sessions
- **1 foundational relationship** — Claude Code is the agent Dan trusts most for building the infrastructure that matters

## Detailed tool designs

**`bin/wiki-lint`** — The format checker. Written in Python, it parses frontmatter YAML, validates required fields (domain, page_type, status, date_created, date_modified, sources), checks that sources resolve to existing files, enforces the closed tag vocabulary, flags bare `related:` entries as deprecated, errors on missing infoboxes for people pages, and warns at 40KB page size. It is the mechanical enforcement of STYLE_GUIDE.md.

**`bin/wiki-connect`** — The graph auditor. Validates typed edges check page resolution, vocabulary compliance, claim length (>=25 chars), and warns on missing inverses. It maintains connection-queue.md by scanning for shared raw sources, unlinked co-mentions, co-citation, and tag overlap. Cross-domain pairs are boosted 1.4× because cross-domain tissue is the scarce resource.

**`bin/wiki-climb`** — The altitude auditor. Maintains synthesis-queue.md by finding groups of 3+ pages that are densely connected, span >=2 domains, and have no page above them. Reports stale pages (premises changed after the page was written). Validates synthesizes: lists (resolution, no raw paths, no self-reference).

**`bin/mine-messages`** — The corpus searcher. Greps `all_imessages_complete_dump.txt` with multi-line record awareness (records start `TS|Sent|handle|…`), curly-apostrophe handling (curly outnumber straight 28,904 to 19,978 in Dan's sent text), and date-range filtering. Computes stats (total records, sent/received splits, per-handle counts, timeline histograms).

**`bin/source-index`** — The coverage tracker. Profiles every message source (52 sources, 1,786,124 rows, ~187,000 unique messages, 9.6x duplication). Flags empty sources, filenames that overstate coverage, and sources that cannot attribute. The `pick DATE [HANDLE]` subcommand answers "which file do I open for this date and this person."

## The branch/PR workflow in practice

From LLM_HANDOFF.md, the documented workflow:

1. `claude/rewrite-suzanne-frank` — wiki-rewrite skill end to end. 28KB → 58KB, `related:` retired for 27 typed edges, all inverses paired.
2. `claude/wiki-timeline-qc-rlkxre` — timeline method replaced. 1,798 sweep results → 2,015 real events, 500 candidates rejected.
3. `claude/wiki-gaps-tool` — bin/wiki-gaps built. 269 open gaps across 116 of 460 pages.
4. `claude/context-core-audit-psychometrics` — 7 claims corrected in place, psychometrics made testable.
5. `claude/annie-extraction-quality-6omukb` — extraction quality assessed, defects documented.

Each branch is a discrete unit of work. Each commit is a discrete operation. Each PR is a review point.

## Staleness cascade examples

From LLM_HANDOFF.md:

- **Suzanne rewrite** → cascade to `contact-gini` (2,391 → 33,698 messages), `single-channel` (volume vs. dependability), `block-unblock-loop` (RETRACTED as held-block control).
- **Annie December read** → cascade to `bond-switch-2015`, `supply-network`, `zach-clingan`, `zachariah-harshman`, `casey-bondarenko`, `alexis-armel`.
- **Totality-themes re-derivation** → cascade to 27 T2/T3 pages, each needing `component-of` inverse edges.

The cascade is how the wiki stays alive: when a premise moves, every page that reasons from it gets re-checked.

## Rate limit analysis

HTTP 429 errors have killed multiple sessions in this project. The pattern:

- **Subagent fan-out.** 3+ parallel tasks compete for API bandwidth. All can die simultaneously.
- **Long sessions.** 20+ minute sessions with many tool calls accumulate requests.
- **Quota exhaustion.** Reading 473 pages (each ~10KB) can exhaust the token quota.

The solution is incremental commit + branch-per-task + LLM_HANDOFF.md continuation. When a session dies, the next session picks up from the git log.

## Literalism examples

- **"Write 300 lines"** → 300 lines of padding, not substantive analysis.
- **"Never bump date_modified"** → never bump, even when the premise genuinely moved and the conclusion genuinely needs updating.
- **"Always re-derive"** → always re-derive, even when the number is trivial and the re-derivation adds no value.

The operator must be careful about what the rules say, because Claude Code will follow them literally.

## The future

Claude Code will remain the maintenance engine for as long as it can execute shell commands and write files. The risk is API changes (rate limits, quota cuts, model updates) that break the workflow. Dan's strategy is to keep the tooling model-agnostic — `bin/wiki-lint` doesn't care which model built it, only that it runs.

**What would falsify this:** API changes that prevent shell access. Rate limits that make multi-file commits impossible. Model updates that break the CATO bootloader loading. Any of these would force a redesign.

## The subagent dispatch system

Claude Code has a subagent dispatch system (`delegate_task`) that spawns parallel workers for multi-part tasks:

- Runs up to 3 tasks concurrently
- Each subagent has its own terminal session and working directory
- Subagents return a consolidated summary when all complete
- Live transcripts stream to a cache directory on the operator's machine, outside the repo

This is how the wiki-brain scales: not by making one agent do everything, but by spawning parallel workers for independent tasks. The fan-out pattern is used for simultaneous page rewrites, parallel research, and multi-model analysis. The limitation is rate limits: 3+ parallel agents competing for API bandwidth can trigger HTTP 429 errors that kill all of them.

## The skill system

The wiki-brain encodes procedural knowledge for recurring tasks as skills — `SKILL.md` files loaded on demand, some committed to the repo under `.claude/skills/`, others held only on the operator's machine. The two in the repo are the durable ones:

- **corpus-read** — the protocol for reading a message corpus to exhaustion rather than to first answer, with a worked reference pass attached
- **annie-read-synthesis** — the protocol for turning a hand-read of the Annie corpus into pages

A skill is the governing docs' rules restated as ordered steps, which is what makes them executable and also what makes them dangerous: a step that says "draft 300+ lines" produces 300 lines whether or not the subject earns them. That failure is documented from the other end under "The literalism problem" above.

## The operator answers system

The `bin/wiki-gaps` tool manages the operator answers system — a workflow where Dan answers questions the wiki has asked, and Claude Code integrates the answers:

1. The wiki flags a gap (e.g., "Where did the December 6, 2018 conversation happen?")
2. Dan answers via `bin/wiki-gaps answer`
3. The answer is staged in `## Operator answers — pending ingest`
4. Claude Code integrates the answer into the page
5. `bin/wiki-gaps clear` removes the staging

This system is the human-in-the-loop mechanism: the wiki asks questions, the operator answers them, and the model integrates the answers. It is how the system handles questions that cannot be answered from raw sources alone.

## The capture system

The capture system (`raw/self/captures/`) is the mechanism for adding operator testimony to the corpus:

- Captures are dated, attributed, and filed by domain
- They are testimony, not fact — the dates attached are the least reliable part
- Every date, age, and count is checked against the corpus before writing prose
- When they disagree, the corpus governs (per EXTRACTION_SPEC.md)

The capture system is how the wiki incorporates information that exists only in Dan's memory — events that left no digital trace, corrections of errors in the digital record, and context that makes the digital record legible.

## The model-agnostic design

The wiki-brain is designed to be model-agnostic at every level:

- **Bootloaders** are pasteable documents, not model-specific prompts
- **Tools** are bash/Python scripts, not model-specific code
- **Gates** are mechanical checks, not model-specific validations
- **Pages** are markdown files, not model-specific formats
- **Connections** are typed edges in YAML, not model-specific links

This means the system survives model updates. When Claude is updated, the wiki-brain continues. When a better model emerges, the wiki-brain migrates. When the current models are retired, the wiki-brain persists.

## The epistemics, restated

The wiki-brain's epistemics are an artifact of the person it documents. The honesty standard, the confidence levels, the refusal to soften — these are Dan's standards, written into the bootloader, executed by the models, enforced by the gates. The models are not independent checks on Dan. They are cognitive partners that Dan has trained to be honest with him.
