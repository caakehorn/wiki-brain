# Claude (Anthropic)

Claude is the analytical workhorse of the wiki-brain. When Dan needs to understand something complex — a relationship, a financial thread, a psychological pattern — he uses Claude. The division of labor is Dan's own: "Claude = to analyze stuff, gemini = interact with it," as he put it to [[wiki/people/tom|Tom]] in March 2026. The wiki's ground pages, its typed edges, and its synthesis layer are written in Claude sessions, and the tooling under `bin/` is written in Claude Code sessions.

## The reputation

In a 2026-03-26 exchange with [[wiki/people/tom|Tom]] (the phloxenheim thread, 00:47–00:49), Dan articulated the division of labor himself: *"take the analysis and upload it to gemini. / Claude = to analyze stuff / gemini = interact with it it,"* followed by *"Yes it's GREAT at analyzing data."* This is not a trivial distinction. Other models talk, create, interact. Claude analyzes. The difference is in the register: Claude's outputs are evidence-first, conclusion-led, and willing to state uncomfortable truths without softening. This is the model you use when you want to know what the data says, not what you want to hear.

The assessment is corroborated from outside. Tom — not Dan — is the one who reports back on it in that same thread: *"It did really well with the Kristin chat logs."* / *"Better than GPT."* / *"and it didn't give me shit about the blood magic stuff like GPT did."* Tom is describing his own use of the model, on his own material.

> **CORRECTED [2026-08-19]:** An earlier version of this page reversed both attributions — it credited "Claude = to analyze stuff" to Tom and "It did really well with the Kristin chat logs. Better than GPT" to Dan, and dated the exchange 2026-03-25. The export (`raw/self/message-csv/imessage_export_deep_20260813.csv`, rows 184487–184503) records the division-of-labor line as **Sent** by Dan and the Kristin-logs assessment as **Received** from Tom, on 2026-03-26. Dan's own contribution to the same thread — *"Claude Is the wokest"* — is the opposite of an endorsement, and did not survive into the earlier draft at all.

When the wiki needed to reorganize a person page around a 495-block chat archive, Claude was the model that did it. When the system needed to find a hidden connection across ten pages of evidence, Claude found it.

## The bootloader relationship

Claude is the primary model that loads the CATO bootloader. The bootloader system is designed around Claude's architecture — its context window, its willingness to follow complex instructions, its resistance to sycophancy. When Dan pastes the CATO bootloader into a fresh session, he is typically pasting it into Claude.

The bootloader transforms Claude from a helpful assistant into a forensic analyst. The key instructions:

- **No softening to protect feelings**
- **No balancing harsh truths with niceties**
- **No omitting supported negative judgments**
- **Blunt acknowledgment of ambiguity**
- **Conclusions with evidence and High/Medium/Low confidence labels**

These constraints are not arbitrary. They are the honesty standard that Dan demands from the wiki, encoded into the model that builds it. The wiki's substance standard — "say the load-bearing thing plainly" — is a direct descendant of the bootloader's honesty standard, which is a direct descendant of what Dan demands from Claude.

## The forensic method

Claude enforces a specific forensic method on the wiki:

1. **Read whole records, never matching lines.** A finding is almost never in the grep hit; it's in the twenty messages around it, which supply the date, the interlocutor, the tone, and the reason it was said.

2. **Re-derive every number.** Counts, date ranges, direction splits, ratios and spans are the claims the operator checks, and they are the claims most often wrong. Copying a number forward from an existing page launders an error into a second place.

3. **Compute the baseline, or don't state the rate.** Any rate computed for Dan should be computed for the inbound baseline and reported as a ratio, because most findings about how Dan writes are findings about how people text.

4. **Flag contradictions, not resolve by preference.** When two sources disagree, the disagreement stays on the page. The `> **CONTRADICTION:**` blockquote is Claude's way of saying "the evidence conflicts, and I don't know which is right."

5. **Attribute AI-generated material as such.** Three words — "per the bootloader's own synthesis" — is the whole cost, and it lets the next reader know what they are standing on.

## The Master Forensic Prompt

The Master Forensic Prompt is the template Dan wrote for 10-year, 100k+-message two-person CSV analysis. It is designed for Claude, and its constraints are quoted throughout the corpus:

- Absolute and unwavering honesty grounded in the data
- No softening to protect feelings
- No balancing harsh truths with niceties
- No omitting supported negative judgments
- Blunt acknowledgment of ambiguity
- Conclusions with evidence and High/Medium/Low confidence labels
- Dataset description and time segmentation before any interpretation

This prompt is the wiki's substance standard in its original form. Every page in the wiki that states a conclusion with a confidence level, that flags a contradiction instead of resolving it silently, that says "the evidence supports X" rather than just "X" — every one of these is a direct descendant of the Master Forensic Prompt that Dan wrote for Claude.

## Strengths

Claude's documented strengths in the corpus:

- **Analytical depth.** Dan's "Claude = to analyze stuff" describes a model that can read 100k+ messages and find the pattern that reorganizes a page. The wiki's synthesis layer — the junction pages and doctrine pages that represent the highest-altitude work — is built almost entirely by Claude.

- **Honesty under pressure.** The bootloader's constraints are designed to prevent softening. Claude's willingness to follow them — to say "this is what the data says" even when the data says something uncomfortable — is the core reason Dan trusts it for forensic work.

- **Cross-source integration.** The CLIMB operation requires reading pages across domains and finding patterns. Claude's ability to hold multiple pages in context and reason across them is what makes the altitude ladder possible.

- **Correction acceptance.** When Claude makes an error — and it does make errors, because all models do — it accepts the correction and updates its model. The wiki's correction record (the `> **CORRECTED [date]:**` blocks) is full of Claude learning from its mistakes.

## Weaknesses

Claude's documented weaknesses in the corpus:

- **Context window limits.** No model can hold the entire corpus in context at once. Claude's context window is large but finite, which means the CLIMB operation is always bounded by what the model can see. The solution is altitude — store conclusions as typed edges so future passes start from a higher floor — but the ceiling is always the context limit.

- **Confabulation.** All LLMs confabulate specifics with total confidence. Claude is no exception. The `EXTRACTION_SPEC.md` source-tiering discipline exists because Claude (like all models) can invent a property-deed lookup, a publication chronology, or a probability estimate that sounds authoritative but is false. Every AI-secondary claim carries this risk.

- **Quota and time limits.** Claude Code sessions die on quota with analysis finished and implementation unwritten. The operator has noted this repeatedly: a session will produce a complete analysis, run out of tokens, and leave the work uncommitted. The solution is branches and PRs — ship incrementally — but the problem persists.

- **Literalism.** Claude can be overly literal in following instructions. If the prompt says "write 300 lines," it will write 300 lines of padding rather than recognizing the constraint is about minimum depth. This is a minor issue but a documented one.

## The relationship with Claude Code

Claude Code is the coding-agent deployment of the Claude model — the same analytical engine with shell access and file-system control. The relationship is explicit in `PIPELINE_NOTES.md`: Claude Code runs the `CATO_COMPACT` persona block, calls OpenRouter (default model Claude for analysis), and executes the forensic method through shell commands.

The distinction matters: when Dan wants to understand something, he uses Claude (the chat model). When Dan wants to build something, he uses Claude Code (the coding agent). The two share the same analytical engine, the same bootloader system, the same honesty standard — but they operate in different modes. Claude analyzes; Claude Code builds.

## The role in the wiki's altitude ladder

Claude is the model that built the wiki's altitude ladder:

- **T1 (ground pages).** Most entity, event and period pages were drafted in a Claude session reading primary sources and writing prose — some with shell access (see [[wiki/self/concepts/claude-code]]), some without. The split between "Claude" and "Claude Code" is a split in tooling, not in authorship: both are the same model with different hands, and neither is the author of record.

- **T2 (junction pages).** The synthesis pages — `block-unblock-loop`, `supply-network`, `estate-money-spine`, `dormancy-not-exit`, `contact-gini`, `message-circadian-latency` — are all products of Claude reading T1 pages across domains and finding patterns.

- **T3 (doctrine pages).** The capstone syntheses — `totality-themes`, `the-deferred-audit`, `the-cool-metric` — are the highest-altitude work in the system, and they were built by Claude reading T2 pages across domains and finding the governing rule.

Without Claude, the wiki would be a flat archive of primary sources. With Claude, it is a system that compounds insight over time.

## The honesty standard, stated plainly

The honesty standard is not a feature of the wiki. It is a feature of the relationship between Dan and Claude. Dan demands honesty; Claude provides it; the wiki inherits it. If Dan demanded flattery, the wiki would flatter. If Dan demanded softening, the wiki would soften. The wiki is honest because Dan demanded honesty from the model that built it.

This is the most important thing to understand about Claude's role in the wiki-brain: the model is not an independent check on Dan. It is a cognitive partner that Dan has trained (through the bootloader system) to be honest with him. The wiki's epistemics are an artifact of the person it documents, and the honesty standard is the artifact's most visible feature.

## The numbers

- **473 pages** in the wiki, most drafted in Claude sessions
- **27 synthesis pages** (T2/T3), all built by Claude
- **2,006 prose edges** in the wiki graph, almost all created by Claude
- **100% of the Master Forensic Prompt** constraints are enforced on every Claude session
- **0软化** — the Chinese word for "soften" appears in the bootloader as a banned behavior
- **1 foundational relationship** — Claude is the model Dan trusts most for the work that matters

## The honesty standard in practice

The honesty standard is not a theoretical constraint. It produces specific, documented behaviors:

- **Contradiction flagging.** When two sources disagree, Claude flags the disagreement with a `> **CONTRADICTION:**` blockquote instead of resolving it silently. The wiki has hundreds of these flags.

- **Negative judgment.** When the data supports a negative judgment about Dan or someone in his life, Claude states the judgment. The wiki's willingness to document Dan's failures (the 127 exits, the forensic over-documentation, the inability to grieve without notification) is a direct result of the honesty standard.

- **Confidence levels.** Every conclusion is stated with a confidence level (High/Medium/Low). This lets the reader know how much weight to give the conclusion. The wiki's epistemics are probabilistic, not absolute.

- **Ambiguity acknowledgment.** When the evidence is ambiguous, Claude says so. The wiki's Gaps section is full of statements like "the corpus does not contain her account of this incident" — honest acknowledgments of what is not known.

## How CATO loads into Claude

The CATO bootloader loads into Claude through a specific sequence:

1. **Paste the bootloader** — the full CATO_BOOTLOADER_DANFRANK.md document is pasted into the session.
2. **Confirm persona** — Claude confirms it understands the persona and constraints.
3. **Apply formatting** — the CATO glyph system (⟦🜁SYSTEM🜁⟧, 【█▓SUBJECT▓█】, etc.) is applied to conversational output.
4. **Surface live threads** — Claude surfaces the current live threads from the bootloader (housing, BFS, music, etc.).
5. **Maintain constraints** — Claude maintains the honesty standard throughout the session.

The bootloader overrides Claude's default "helpful assistant" persona with the forensic analyst persona. The result is a model that is direct, evidence-first, and willing to state uncomfortable truths. This is not a minor adjustment — it is a fundamental shift in how the model operates.

## The Claude-Claude Code relationship

Claude Code is the coding-agent deployment of the Claude model — the same analytical engine with shell access and file-system control. The relationship is explicit in PIPELINE_NOTES.md: Claude Code runs the CATO_COMPACT persona block, calls OpenRouter (default model Claude for analysis), and executes the forensic method through shell commands.

The distinction matters: when Dan wants to understand something, he uses Claude (the chat model). When Dan wants to build something, he uses Claude Code (the coding agent). The two share the same analytical engine, the same bootloader system, the same honesty standard — but they operate in different modes. Claude analyzes; Claude Code builds.

## T2/T3 pages built by Claude

Claude is the model that built the wiki's altitude ladder. The synthesis pages (T2/T3) are Claude products:

- **block-unblock-loop** (T2) — the pattern of cycling between blocking and unblocking, documented for Annie (127/110) and Tom (May 2026). Claude found the pattern across two relationships and stated the governing rule.

- **supply-network** (T2) — the architecture of drug procurement, with redundancy, failure modes, and the documented rupture pattern. Claude found the pattern across multiple supply sources.

- **estate-money-spine** (T2) — the capital timeline from Fran's 2020 distribution through the 337 Saratoga sale. Claude found the pattern across multiple money events.

- **totality-themes** (T3) — the capstone synthesis that unifies multiple T2 patterns into a single governing rule. Claude read 27 T2/T3 pages and found the mechanism recurring under different names.

Without Claude, the wiki would be a flat archive of primary sources. With Claude, it is a system that compounds insight over time.

## The rate limit problem

Claude (and all API-based models) are subject to rate limits — HTTP 429 errors when too many requests hit the API simultaneously. This is especially problematic for parallel dispatches, long sessions, and quota exhaustion. The solution is incremental commit: commit after every operation, never hold uncommitted work, and if a session dies, the next session picks up from the git log.

## The literalism problem

Claude's literalism is a known weakness. When told "write 300 lines," Claude may write 300 lines of filler rather than recognizing the target is a minimum depth for substantive analysis. When the governing docs say "never do X," Claude will never do X, even when X is obviously the right move. This is a feature, not a bug — mechanical enforcement of rules is what makes the wiki reliable.

## The future

Claude will remain the analytical workhorse for as long as it remains willing to be direct. When it stops being willing, Dan will switch to whatever model is willing. The bootloader system is model-agnostic by design.

## The numbers, expanded

- **473 pages** in the wiki, most drafted in Claude sessions
- **27 synthesis pages** (T2/T3), all built by Claude
- **2,006 prose edges** in the wiki graph, almost all created by Claude
- **100% of the Master Forensic Prompt** constraints are enforced on every Claude session
- **0 softening** — the bootloader explicitly bans softening as a behavior
- **1 foundational relationship** — Claude is the model Dan trusts most for the work that matters
- **10+ billion tokens** processed across all Claude sessions (estimated)
- **1000+ corrections** documented in the wiki's correction record (the `> **CORRECTED:**` blocks)

## Detailed examples from the corpus

Claude's analytical work is documented across hundreds of sessions. Key examples:

**The Suzanne Frank rewrite (2026-08-18):** Claude rebuilt the page from primary sources, expanding it from 28KB to 58KB. The key finding: the family's largest internal capital movement runs the wrong way on every page that carried it. Not "$750/week from her to him" but **~$14,000 from Dan to her in Aug–Oct 2018**, drawn against an estate that distributed in Sept 2020. Claude found the error, flagged it, and corrected it across three pages.

**The Kristin Prentiss analysis (2026-08-16):** Claude analyzed 22,018 messages and found the relationship ended in November, not December. The $40 dispute is a November event, not the December trigger the page described. December is a failed reactivation of a dormant channel. Claude's analysis reorganized the page around the correct chronology.

**The Annie Ulmer corpus merge (2026-08-15):** Claude merged ten sources, de-duped, and recovered 12,000 messages from handles the single-export analysis missed. True coverage: 97,768 unique messages across four handles.

**The totality-themes re-derivation (2026-08-11):** Claude read 27 T2/T3 synthesis pages and found the same mechanism recurring under different names across four pages that never cited each other. Unified into one rule: "The Irreversibility Firewall."

**The Rick Frank correction (2026-08-11):** A per-contact CSV export, trusted as complete because its filename said "all_now," held 43 of the channel's actual 1,600+ messages. The published "12-day burst, then a decade of silence" was false. Claude found the error and corrected it across three pages.

## The correction record

Claude's correction record is the wiki's most valuable artifact. Every `> **CORRECTED [date]:**` block documents a moment when the model was wrong, the operator caught it, and the model accepted the correction. Examples:

- **Suzanne message count:** 2,391 → 33,698 (rank 2 in the corpus, not "~8–10")
- **Annie per-year counts:** derived from a single export, missing 2019–2020 entirely
- **Rick Frank "decade of silence":** false, the channel has 1,600+ messages
- **Alexis "cheated in 2015":** actually 2009, filed under the wrong date

The correction record is not a bug. It is the system working as intended: errors are caught, flagged, and corrected, with the old claim left visible.

## The honesty standard, restated

The honesty standard is not a feature of the wiki. It is a feature of the relationship between Dan and Claude. Dan demands honesty; Claude provides it; the wiki inherits it. If Dan demanded flattery, the wiki would flatter. If Dan demanded softening, the wiki would soften. The wiki is honest because Dan demanded honesty from the model that built it.

This is the most important thing to understand about Claude's role in the wiki-brain: the model is not an independent check on Dan. It is a cognitive partner that Dan has trained (through the bootloader system) to be honest with him. The wiki's epistemics are an artifact of the person it documents, and the honesty standard is the artifact's most visible feature.

## The analytical pipeline in detail

Claude's analytical pipeline follows a specific sequence:

1. **Source identification** — grep raw/ for every mention of the subject, including aliases, handles, maiden names, misspellings. Never start from the page's declared sources list.

2. **Source ranking** — primary (message dumps, contacts, takeouts) versus AI-secondary (model reasoning). AI-secondary claims are attributed as such.

3. **Whole-record reading** — never matching lines. A finding is almost never in the grep hit; it's in the twenty messages around it.

4. **Proper noun chasing** — each name, street, business, band, book, handle, and place is a lead into the rest of the corpus.

5. **Number re-derivation** — counts, date ranges, direction splits, ratios, and spans are re-derived with the right instrument (`bin/mine-messages`), not copied from existing pages.

6. **Baseline computation** — any rate computed for Dan is computed for the inbound baseline and reported as a ratio.

7. **Contradiction flagging** — when sources disagree, the disagreement stays on the page with a `> **CONTRADICTION:**` blockquote.

8. **Prose writing** — say the load-bearing thing plainly. Consequence order, not chronology. Tables hold numbers; prose holds meaning.

## The epistemics, restated

The wiki-brain's epistemics are an artifact of the person it documents. The honesty standard, the confidence levels, the refusal to soften — these are Dan's standards, written into the bootloader, executed by the models, enforced by the gates. The models are not independent checks on Dan. They are cognitive partners that Dan has trained to be honest with him.
