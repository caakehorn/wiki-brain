# Read-Receipt Forensics — chat.db Metadata and Its Traps

Derived from a single extraction session, 2026-08-09. Three defects, each of
which **silently produces a confident wrong answer rather than an error.** That
is the failure mode the forensic method is least protected against, which is why
this is a page and not a footnote.

> **Sourcing note.** The session this page documents ran directly against the
> operator's local `chat.db` (macOS Messages, requiring Full Disk Access — see
> the extraction recipe below) rather than against a CSV filed in this
> repository's `raw/`. No `raw/` export corresponding to the 230-row
> `annie_metadata_24h.csv` extract cited throughout has been filed as of this
> ingest; `sources:` above is left empty rather than pointing at a file that
> does not exist on disk, per `bin/wiki-lint`'s source check. Filing that
> export is the open item — see `queue.md`.

## M1 — `date_read` is directional and asymmetric

The single most consequential fact about the column, and it is not documented
anywhere obvious.

```
ON is_from_me = 1  (messages you SENT)
    date_read = when THE OTHER PARTY opened your message.
    Requires THEIR read receipts to be ON. Absent entirely otherwise.

ON is_from_me = 0  (messages you RECEIVED)
    date_read = when YOU opened their message.
    Recorded LOCALLY, ALWAYS, regardless of anyone's settings.
```

Observed in the 2026-08-08/09 extract:

```
RECEIVED rows with date_read :  81 / 101   (all of them are Dan)
SENT     rows with date_read :  44 / 129   (all of them are her)
```

**Reading the column as one undifferentiated thing produces the conclusion that
the counterparty was continuously active all day.** She was not visible at all
before 23:10:40. Half the column is a log of the operator's own behaviour.

**Rule:** always split by `is_from_me` before computing any latency statistic.
Never aggregate across directions.

## M2 — `reply_to_guid` is not a reply marker

```
reply_to_guid == guid of the immediately preceding message :  179 / 181
reply_to_guid pointing anywhere else (a true inline reply) :    2 / 181
thread_originator_guid populated (the real marker)         :    2 / 230
```

`reply_to_guid` is **auto-populated with the previous message in the thread.**
It carries no intent. The genuine inline-reply marker is
`thread_originator_guid`.

**Consequence:** any argument of the form *"she replied inline to message X,
therefore she had the thread open, therefore the absence of a read receipt means
she disabled them"* is **void**. That argument was built and then withdrawn
during the 2026-08-09 session.

**Action owed:** audit the corpus for prior analysis that treated
`reply_to_guid` as intentional threading. Any such claim needs rechecking.

## M3 — SQLite type-affinity trap

`strftime('%s', ...)` returns **TEXT**. When compared against a **computed
expression** — which carries no column affinity — SQLite ranks INTEGER below
TEXT unconditionally, so the predicate is **silently false for every row**.

Reproduced directly:

```
expression >= strftime('%s','now','-24 hours')                 →  0 rows
expression >= CAST(strftime('%s','now','-24 hours') AS INTEGER) →  1 row
```

This produced a zero-byte export that initially read as a substantive finding
about the data rather than a bug in the query. No error was raised.

**Canonical form** — cast explicitly, and keep the arithmetic on the right so
the index on `m.date` is usable:

```sql
AND m.date >= (CAST(strftime('%s','now','-24 hours') AS INTEGER) - 978307200) * 1000000000
```

Note also that a column *with* INTEGER affinity coerces the TEXT operand
correctly, so the same comparison works in one query and fails in another. That
inconsistency is what makes it dangerous.

## M4 — Absence of metadata is weak evidence in this corpus

```
SENT rows with NO delivered_at at all :  41 / 129
```

Clustered rather than random — a device-sync artifact (Mac vs. phone), not a
signal about the counterparty. **Any argument from a missing timestamp must
carry this caveat.** The record is incomplete by construction.

## Extraction recipe

Full-metadata pull for a single handle, macOS. Copy the database first — reading
it live risks a lock, and the `-wal` file holds messages not yet checkpointed
into the main file.

```bash
cp ~/Library/Messages/chat.db* /tmp/ ; sqlite3 -header -csv /tmp/chat.db "
SELECT datetime(m.date/1000000000+978307200,'unixepoch','localtime') sent_at,
  CASE m.is_from_me WHEN 1 THEN 'SENT' ELSE 'RECEIVED' END direction,
  CASE WHEN m.date_delivered>0 THEN datetime(m.date_delivered/1000000000+978307200,'unixepoch','localtime') END delivered_at,
  CASE WHEN m.date_read>0 THEN datetime(m.date_read/1000000000+978307200,'unixepoch','localtime') END read_at,
  CASE WHEN m.date_read>0 THEN (m.date_read-m.date)/1000000000 END secs_to_read,
  m.is_read, m.is_delivered, m.is_sent, m.is_delayed, m.error, m.item_type,
  m.associated_message_type, m.thread_originator_guid, m.service, m.guid, m.ROWID,
  COALESCE(m.text,'') text
FROM message m
WHERE m.ROWID IN (SELECT message_id FROM chat_message_join WHERE chat_id IN
   (SELECT chat_id FROM chat_handle_join WHERE handle_id IN (<ROWIDs>)))
AND m.date >= (CAST(strftime('%s','now','-24 hours') AS INTEGER)-978307200)*1000000000
ORDER BY m.date;" > ~/Desktop/out.csv
```

Resolve handle ROWIDs first — a contact may have several, and a `LIKE '%2449%'`
pattern will sweep in unrelated numbers:

```bash
sqlite3 /tmp/chat.db "SELECT ROWID, id FROM handle WHERE id LIKE '%<digits>';"
```

Requires **Full Disk Access** on the terminal. Without it the `cp` fails; do not
suppress its stderr, or the failure presents as an empty result set.

`m.text` is NULL for most recent messages on Monterey — the body lives in
`attributedBody` as a serialised `NSAttributedString`. This extract is for
metadata; pull text separately and join on timestamp.

## Why this page exists

Three of the four defects above produced, at some point in one session, a
**confident and wrong** intermediate conclusion: a zero-row result read as a
finding, a directional column read as undirectional, and an auto-populated field
read as intentional. None raised an error. The forensic method's exposure is not
to hard failures — it is to instruments that lie quietly and in the direction of
whatever is already suspected.

## RE-CHECKED [2026-08-20] — M4 gains its best real-world case, and the flagship example's scope was an artifact

Flagged stale against [[wiki/mind/concepts/forensic-method]] (edge additions
only, no claim on this page affected) and
[[wiki/timeline/events/august-2026-unmasking]], which gained substantive
prose. The second one matters.

**A scope correction on the worked example.** The unmasking page framed August
8–9 as ending with an unanswered message at 03:41:32. The fuller export filed
2026-08-20 shows the exchange resumed at 08:19 the same morning and ran all
day. That is a scope artifact of the 24-hour metadata extract, not an error in
the method — but it is exactly the failure mode **M4** warns about, applied to
a page's *framing* rather than to a single row: the absence of traffic at the
edge of an extraction window looks like the absence of traffic.

**M4 gains its strongest case, and it is not about metadata at all.** M4 holds
that in this corpus the absence of a signal is weak evidence. The August 16–19
window supplies a harder version of the same lesson, one level up:
**the presence of a signal does not identify its author.** At least six inbound
rows on Annie's 212 handle across July–August 2026 were typed by
[[wiki/people/jerel-coles|Coles]] holding her phone, in three separate
episodes, all during crises. There is no column for this. Read-receipt
analysis is especially exposed to it, because a receipt proves a *device* was
unlocked and looking, and this corpus now contains documented periods in which
the person holding that device was not its owner.

**Recommended addition to the extraction recipe, unimplemented.** Before
drawing a behavioural inference from device-level metadata in any window, check
whether the window overlaps a known third-party-access episode. The three known
ones are 2026-07-26 05:39–05:57, 2026-08-16 23:42–23:53 and 2026-08-18
21:46–21:50. Whether earlier ones exist has not been checked, and the only
detector available is register.

**No method-level finding on this page is withdrawn.** M1–M3 are properties of
`chat.db` and are untouched.

## Gaps

The underlying `annie_metadata_24h.csv` this page's counts are drawn from has
not been filed to `raw/self/message-csv/` — see the sourcing note above. Prior
corpus analyses that used `reply_to_guid` as a threading signal (M2) have not
yet been audited; that audit is owed and is listed in `BACKLOG.md`.
