# John Carney

> **RE-CHECKED [2026-08-20]:** flagged stale against [[wiki/legal/463-morgantown]] (2026-08-20). That page gained a section on the address as a threat vector and one typed edge. Re-read against

**Role:** Contractor at 463 Morgantown St. Unreachable; work ~10-20% complete. Parallel mentions of Carney's Auto Repair Services in location history (possible variant or same network).

## Roles, Dates, Evidence, Ties Table

| Aspect | Details | Evidence/Date | Financial/Legal Ties | Source |
|--------|---------|---------------|----------------------|--------|
| 463 Contractor | General work (incomplete); unreachable | ~10-20% complete (per 463 timeline); status as of ~2026-03 | Exposure via incomplete performance on property | [[wiki/legal/463-morgantown]], risks.md |
| "John carney thing" | Prior analysis / dossier shared | 2026-03-27: Suz: "I just read the John carney thing. Did you read it? The last few pages are Very interesting." | Indicates forensic review (messages corpus) | raw message-csv 2026-03-27 |
| Other Carney refs | "So Carney got pulled over on his way back from here..."; "giving john carney a fucking neck massage" | 2025-03-09 (pulled over); 2025-05-28 (massage context) | N/A direct tie to 463 | imessages_2124702449_last6months.csv |
| Location variant | Carney's Auto Repair Services | 2019-02 visits | Possible auto services network | Location Semantic History |
| Owner context | Oversight by Jackson Alexander | 463 property | Liens/work attach to title | [[wiki/people/alexander-jackson]] |
| Parallel Arnu | Co-contractor activity | 2026-02-10 paint refs | Lien deadline shared risk | arnu page, message-csv |

## Timeline Snippets

- 2025-03/05: Early Carney mentions in personal messages (pullover, massage context -- may be separate).
- 2026-02-10: Arnu/Felix paint at 463 (parallel contractor activity).
- 2026-03-27: "John carney thing" read by Suz; analysis agreed with.
- ~2026: 10-20% work complete + unreachable at 463.
- ~2026-07-27: Arnu lien deadline (Carney risk concurrent).

## Behavioral / Core Notes

Fits [[wiki/self/context-core]] §5 work/housing exit patterns and [[wiki/mind/synthesis/vertical-authority-skepticism]] (unreachable contractors as vertical extraction/low-accountability vectors; parallel to BFS "off-books" and blame pivots). Unreachable status exemplifies low-trust architecture (Altruism 1, Trust 9). "John carney thing" shows recursive forensic application to local actors (cf. Bacharach, Ulmer dossiers).

Location history cross suggests possible auto-repair overlap or coincidence in Uniontown network. Owner Jackson Alexander bears ultimate title risk.

**Notes:** "John carney thing" implies dedicated prior analysis (similar to Gemini/Bacharach deep dives); full doc not in reviewed raw but referenced. Distinguish 2025 personal Carney refs from 2026 463 contractor. Defer to full message-csv + future 463 docs. Limited bio; focus on property ties.

**Premise re-check (2026-07-26):** [[wiki/legal/463-morgantown]] moved on 2026-07-18 in a typed-connections pass; the incomplete-work and unreachability facts this page reasons from are unchanged, and the 'John carney thing' document is still absent from raw/.

> **RE-CHECKED [2026-08-02] — premise moved, nothing here depends on the part
> that moved.** [[wiki/legal/463-morgantown]] was updated to record that the Arnu
> mechanics-lien deadline elapsed on ~27 July 2026 with no documented outcome.
> The Carney exposure documented on this page is a separate claim on the same
> property — incomplete work and an unreachable contractor — and is unaffected by
> the Arnu timing. It is also still unresolved: no source read to date records
> the work being re-let, completed, or written off.

## RE-CHECKED [2026-08-18]

`bin/wiki-climb check` flagged this page stale against
[[wiki/legal/463-morgantown]], moved 2026-08-18 for a correction to
[[wiki/people/suzanne-frank|Suz's]] financial position and two new dated rows.

**Nothing here is contradicted.** The incomplete work (~10–20%) and the
unreachable contractor stand as recorded. The correction does bear on the
practical question of remedy: re-letting the Carney work requires money the
contracting counterparty demonstrably does not have — an October 2024 Chapter 13
with ~$157,000 scheduled, self-reported income of $11,000–$14,000 a year, and
the sale of her only asset absorbed by the plan. The realistic outcome is that
the work stays unfinished rather than that it is re-let and pursued.
