    claim: "The thread is an outside record of the camming business at its launch: Dan describes it to a friend in October 2018 in the couple's-project register, and quotes Annie's prior solo cam work as the reason it 'works out really well to do it as a couple.'"

# Bruce Burish

Bruce Burish is a Fayette County contact (724 area code, confirmed via Google
Contacts) and a caddying-era friend — he opens by referencing missing
[[wiki/work/nemacolin-caddying|Nemacolin]] — who resurfaces for one dense,
explicit five-day conversation in October 2018 and then disappears from the
corpus entirely. The occasion is Dan telling him that he and
[[wiki/people/annie-ulmer|Annie]] are starting a webcam show together. The
thread is almost entirely Bruce's enthusiastic, increasingly graphic reaction
to that news, plus a throwaway request for weed next time Dan is in town.

Its value to the wiki is not the friendship, which is thin and undocumented
either side of the window. It is that this is the **camming business described
to an outsider at the moment of launch**, in Dan's own words, to someone with
no stake in it.

## The webcam conversation

Bruce responds with immediate, sustained interest: how the couple arrived at
the idea, whether Dan's girlfriend had done cam work before — *"Annie did it
before we started dating and it actually works out really well to do it as a
couple"* is Dan's own line, quoted back approvingly — and pushes for a schedule
so he can watch. The register holds for most of two days: solicited detail
about the setup, joking self-comparison (*"I'm Ocho"*), and repeated
propositions to be included in a session in person when he is next in town in
mid-November.

Interspersed is ordinary friend traffic — asking whether Dan is working,
commentary on a book he had just finished, a passing mention of "K-holes" that
Bruce treats as a new and slightly alarming discovery. The thread ends
October 27 with no indication the November visit happened.

## Corpus dimensions

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Messages | **348** — 167 sent (Dan), 181 received |
| Date range | 2018-10-23 → 2018-10-27 (single dense cluster) |
| Handle | `+17249848911` |
| Source of direction | `all_imessages_complete_dump.txt` |

> **CORRECTED [2026-08-20]:** both versions of this page reported the thread as
> **181 messages**, and the stub added that they were *"all received (export
> artifact — Dan's outbound not captured)."* **181 is exactly the received
> count.** `MASTER_MESSAGES_DB_DUMP.csv` marks everything `Received`, so a page
> built from it reports one-sided threads; the complete dump returns **348**
> records on this handle — 167 of them Dan's. There was no export artifact
> swallowing his side, only the wrong file. This is the same failure documented
> on [[wiki/people/zach-clingan]] and corrected again on
> [[wiki/people/annie-ulmer]]'s alternate-number thread the same day.
>
> The correction matters for what the page *says*, not just its arithmetic: a
> thread previously readable as Bruce talking at Dan is in fact close to
> balanced, and Dan's 167 messages are where the camming detail comes from.

> **MERGED [2026-08-20]:** this entity had two pages — `wiki/people/bruceburish`
> (the fuller account, linked from
> [[wiki/self/message-corpora/master-message-dump]]) and `wiki/people/bruce-burish`
> (a thinner stub carrying the typed edge, orphaned). Same person, same handle,
> same five days. Merged here under the hyphenated slug that every other person
> page uses, per STYLE_GUIDE rule 2 — one page per entity, merge never fork.

## Gaps

- **Did the November visit or any collaboration happen?** No contact appears
  after October 27 in any channel. One paragraph from the operator settles it.
- **The Facebook Messenger thread is unread.**
  `raw/self/facebook/.../bruceburish_t6vdszljtq/` exists in the archive and has
  never been cross-read against this page. It is the only other channel where
  this friendship appears and would date its origin.
- **How the friendship actually started.** "Caddying-era" is inferred from
  Bruce's own nostalgia, not stated. [[wiki/work/nemacolin-caddying]] does not
  name him.
