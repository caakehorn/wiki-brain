Casey Bondarenka was a friend who overstayed his welcome during a chaotic late-2015 stretch involving [[wiki/people/alexis-armel|Alexis]] and Vanessa, then resurfaced sporadically through 2018 (`+17245626199`, 36 messages, Nov 2015 – Oct 2018).

## Late 2015: the friend-circle friction

The bulk of the thread (Nov 29 – Dec 2, 2015) documents Casey inserting himself into Dan's household during a period of relationship turbulence with Alexis: he asks bluntly whether he can pursue her if things end ("if you're breaking things with Alexis... Can I fuck her?"), then spends several days going back and forth about whether he's overstaying his welcome, apologizing repeatedly for "being pushy" and for upsetting Vanessa by smoking at the house. He frames his own behavior as trying to help while acknowledging he doesn't want "legitimate ties" with Alexis, calling her "diabolical AF." The cluster ends with a full apology on February 15, 2016 for "anything I may have done that need apologizing for."

The Annie-side record fills in what he was doing in the house. He is there
buying beer for Alexis at 00:39 on 2015-11-30 while the eviction is being
staged, and drives Dan on errands that afternoon. A dispute about him — Dan's
*"It is bombastic"* (23:00) — is deliberately moved to a phone call and never
restated in text, which is why its content is an open lead rather than a
record. By 2015-12-01 Dan is removing him: *"Im calling Vanessa"*, and on
2015-12-02 he is formally asked to stay away. He is also blamed by both Dan and
Annie as the likely person who told [[wiki/people/ellen-ulmer|Ellen]] that
Annie's car was at Dan's house on 2015-12-02 — the trigger for the family
confrontation — though **the informant is never named** and the attribution
stays unproven.

The same day (Nov 29, 2015, 18:34) also carries Casey warning Dan off an
unnamed woman ("Dude that's a slippery slope with her man... She's a
hoe"), immediately followed by an outbound Dan message — recipient not
mechanically confirmed, since Sent rows carry no `contact_handle` in this
export, but almost certainly addressed to Casey by timing and content, in
the same [[wiki/mind/concepts/dans-law|deconfounding]] spirit as the
rest of the corpus's contested-attribution problems — 
reading "Things are collapsing with lex. You might be seeing a lot more
Annie very soon." Hours later Casey asks "Wait is that Annie?" — read
together, this is the same-day thread in which Casey first learns about
[[wiki/people/annie-ulmer|Annie]], the day Dan met her (see
[[wiki/timeline/periods/2015-2016-annie-relationship-start]]).

## Later contact (2017–2018)

Sporadic, low-effort check-ins follow ("You working today dude?", "You duckin me bro or you just busy?"), with a final October 2018 message noting Casey now has a medical marijuana card and offering to "float" Dan.

## Gaps

- **The "Casey saga."** Whatever Dan called *"bombastic"* on 2015-11-30 moved to
  a phone call and is never restated in text. Look: Dec 1–3 for a retelling.
- **Who told Ellen Ulmer about the car.** Casey is blamed by both parties and
  never confirmed.
- Relationship to [[wiki/people/vanessa-frank|Vanessa Frank]] beyond the smoking incident is undocumented.
