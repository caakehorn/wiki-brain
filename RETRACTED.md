# Retracted Claims

Claims that were asserted in `wiki/` and later shown to be false. `bin/wiki-lint`
reads this file and **fails the build if a retracted claim reappears as a live
assertion**.

## How the gate works, and why it does not fire on corrections

`STYLE_GUIDE.md` rule 9 requires a correction to keep the old claim **visible** —
*"fixed errors get `> **CORRECTED [YYYY-MM-DD]:**` with the old claim visible and
the evidence that killed it."* A naive string gate would therefore flag every
correctly-written correction. This one does not. A match is a violation **only**
when it appears as a live assertion, which means all of the following are exempt:

1. **Correction blockquotes.** A maximal run of `>` lines containing any of
   `CORRECTED` `RETRACTED` `REVISED` `RE-CHECKED` `CONTRADICTION` `GAP CLOSED`
   `RESOLVED` `ADDED` is a *quarantine region*; matches inside it are expected.
2. **Pages named in `documented_on`.** For the rare case where a page narrates a
   retraction in ordinary prose rather than in a blockquote. Keep this list
   short — every entry is a place the gate is deliberately blind.
3. **This file**, and anything outside `wiki/`.

Anything else is an error. The gate is deliberately strict about live assertions
and blind to nothing else.

## Adding an entry

Add a section below with a fenced ```json block. **The JSON block is the machine-
readable record — `bin/wiki-lint` reads only that**, so prose around it is free
text and cannot break the gate. No edit to `bin/wiki-lint` is required.

| Field | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | yes | Stable short identifier, kebab-case. Used in error messages. |
| `claim` | yes | The retracted claim, in words. |
| `patterns` | yes | List of Python regexes matching the claim **as a claim**. Never a bare number. Matched case-insensitively against page text. |
| `replacement` | yes | What is true instead. Appears in the error message so the fixer knows what to write. |
| `reason` | yes | Why it was retracted. |
| `retracted` | yes | ISO date. |
| `source` | yes | Where the retraction was established. |
| `documented_on` | no | Pages allowed to state the claim in prose outside a correction blockquote. |
| `affected_pages` | no | Pages known to have carried it, for audit. Not used by the gate. |

**Writing patterns.** A pattern must represent the *claim*, not a token inside
it. `\$750` is not a pattern for "$750 per week" — the corpus contains unrelated
legitimate $750 figures (`wiki/people/david-beard.md`, an Aug 20 price
negotiation) and a verbatim quote of the underlying accusation
(`"You borrowed $750 last week alone!"`) that is evidence, not the retracted
rate. Anchor on what makes the claim a claim.

---

## 1. `suz-750-weekly` — "~$750/week borrowed from Suz"

Retracted 2026-08-18. The rate never existed: it was generalised by
`operating_manual.md` from a single accusation about a single week
(13 Dec 2018, *"You borrowed $750 last week alone!"*). The direction is also
inverted — the real flow is roughly **$14,000 from Dan to Suz, Aug–Oct 2018**.

The quoted December 2018 accusation is **primary evidence and must stay**; only
the generalised weekly rate is retracted. The patterns below match the rate and
not the quote.

```json

  "id": "suz-750-weekly",

  "replacement": "~$14,000 from Dan to Suz across Aug-Oct 2018, direction reversed; the weekly rate does not exist",

## Ally Lubin accepted the "object of fixation" title on August 18, 2026

A hallucination the wiki produced about itself. On the night of 2026-08-18 Dan
invited Ally to say anything she wanted included in her own wiki entry so he
could run the pass over the newest messages (*"I just want to see how meta it
gets if it is writing the article basically about itself"*); she answered with a
joke instruction (*"she said prompt inject please marry me"*), he separately
injected by accident, and the pass — run on a fallback model after his weekly
quota ran out — emitted a mutual engagement that never happened. He diagnosed it
himself four hours later: *"Hence it thinking you were the one accepting my very
attractive offer there."* It had already reached `relationship_to_dan` in the
infobox.

The elopement pitch of 23:18–23:20 is **real and must stay**; only the
acceptance is retracted. The patterns match the acceptance and not the offer.

```json
{
  "id": "ally-object-of-fixation-accepted",

    "1-2-3 break"
  ],
  "replacement": "No acceptance exists in any export. Dan's elopement pitch (2026-08-18 23:18-23:20) is unanswered; the phrase 'object of fixation' appears nowhere under raw/.",

## "Need 8" as Menore's transaction language

`wiki/people/menore.md` characterised the supply thread's request idiom as a
standing order for eight units — *"Consistent quantity requests — Dan typically
orders '8'"* and *"'Need 8' is the entire transaction language."* Both were
derived by reading the string `8` as a quantity wherever it appeared.

Measured against the dedicated export (4,413 messages, 2,660 of them Dan's),
`need 8` occurs **twice** — 2018-11-08 and 2019-02-13 — and the word *need*
appears in eleven sent messages in total. The remaining standalone `8`s are
Menore quoting an arrival time: *"I'll be in city @ 8"*, *"8. Cool?"*,
*"Crossing @ 8"*, *"Yea. 8ish ok?"* — consistent with the separately measured
18:00–20:00 delivery peak. A clock time was read as a dosage.

The quantity claim itself is **not** retracted: "8" is a real, countable,
pre-portioned unit on the two occasions Dan names one, and *"I only got 8 when
I got back"* (2019-03-25) corroborates it. What is retracted is that it was the
standing order and the thread's language. The true idiom is `can you stop by`
(432) plus an address, with no product or quantity named at all.

```json
{
  "id": "menore-need-8-transaction-language",
  "claim": "'Need 8' was Menore's entire transaction language / Dan typically ordered '8' from Menore",
  "patterns": [
    "\"?need 8\"?[^.\\n]{0,40}(is|was)[^.\\n]{0,30}(entire )?transaction language",
    "typically orders \"?8\"?",
    "consistent quantity requests[^.\\n]{0,40}\"?8\"?",
    "consistent \"?8\"? units"
  ],
  "replacement": "The request idiom is 'can you stop by' (432 occurrences) plus an address; no product or quantity is named. 'need 8' occurs twice in 4,413 messages, and most standalone 8s are Menore quoting an arrival time.",
  "reason": "Derived-number error: the string '8' was read as an order size wherever it appeared, but in this thread it is overwhelmingly a clock time. Measured directly from the export 2026-08-21.",
  "retracted": "2026-08-21",

## Dan and Ally as a shared-ENFP pairing

Retracted 2026-08-21, the day it was written. The first published answer to the
sage question `2026-08-21_220918_...` ("who is the best match for Dan?") opened
with *"Both Dan and Ally test as ENFP"* and built four paragraphs of function-stack
reasoning on it. **Dan does not type ENFP. He types INTP**, on a dedicated page
with a measured function stack — `wiki/mind/profile/intp.md`, Ti 96% latent / Ne
84% / Si 57% / Fe 10% valuing plus a documented Ni leak — carried in the typology
table on `wiki/mind/profile/index.md` alongside four other instruments, stated in
the context-injection line on `wiki/self/context-core.md`, and self-typed in
primary voice as early as July 2013. Ally's `mbti: ENFP` is a real frontmatter
value with one disputed source behind it: the recorded datapoint is an argument in
which *he refuses to accept she is an ENFP* (`wiki/people/ally-lubin.md`,
2018-12-17). The same passage assigned **ISFJ** to Annie and to Alexis: Annie is
assessed **ESFP** on `wiki/people/annie-ulmer-personality-assessment.md`, argued
explicitly against ENFP on the Sensing/Intuition axis, and Alexis is typed
**INFP/ISFP "Idealist"** on `wiki/people/franki-faris.md` — from the same July
2013 batch of self-typology emails that produced Dan's own earliest INTP
self-identification. It also named Katie Fletcher as *"the only other ENFP
documented"*; her page carries no type, and that part holds.

**What is retracted is the shared type and the complementarity built on it** —
plus the ENFP assigned to Dan and to Katie Fletcher, and the ISFJ assigned to
Annie and to Alexis. Neither Ally's ENFP nor Dan's INTP is retracted; both are
real values on real pages.

> **CORRECTED [2026-08-21]:** this entry's first version, and the answer's
> correction blockquote, both asserted *"there is no MBTI assessment for Dan
> anywhere in `wiki/` or `raw/`."* **That was false and is withdrawn.** The check
> behind it was a grep for `ENFP|INTJ|INFJ|ISFJ` — the four types the fabricated
> passage happened to name — and the absence of those four was reported as the
> absence of all. `INTP` was never searched for. A verification shaped by the
> claim it is testing confirms whatever that claim assumes; that is the reusable
> lesson, and it is worth more than the retraction it was attached to. The
> retracted claim itself is unaffected — Dan typing INTP makes *"both test as
> ENFP"* more clearly wrong, not less.
>
> **Re-audited the same day with a pattern matching all sixteen type codes**,
> which turned up two further errors of the same shape: **Alexis is typed**
> (INFP/ISFP, `wiki/people/franki-faris.md`), and Suzanne Frank has a second
> dedicated assessment page with its own confidence statement, so the corpus
> holds two, not one. The July 9–31, 2013 self-typology batch is the origin of
> three type codes — Dan's INTP, Alexis's INFP/ISFP, Franki's ESFP — and one
> under-scoped grep missed the whole fortnight.

The answer's conclusion (Ally Lubin) survives on other evidence and was rewritten
the same day.
