# Intake unit report — cocaine · #1

**Backfilled on 2026-08-31, not written at close.** This unit was closed
through the portal, which writes events straight to `intake/events.jsonl`
and never calls `close`, so no capture was filed at the time. The figures
below are computed from the log as it stands now — including any correction
recorded after the unit closed — rather than as they stood that night.
From here it is the archive copy and is not regenerated.
