## What this closes

`wiki/people/libby.md` was written 2026-08-23 carrying the identification as
**inferred**, on two supports: Dan's own contemporaneous Tumblr link
(`girlfriend-muse-libby-titus-elizabeth-jurist`, 2024-03-17) and a household
"Donald" claiming first use of *gaslighting* in a song. The operator confirms
both the identity and the marriage, and adds the outcome.

## Corroboration found in the corpus after the testimony

The testimony sent the ingesting pass back to the dump, and the corpus turns out
to have carried the answer in plain text the whole time:

| Date | Dir | Content |
|---|---|---|
| 2024-08-08 | Annie | *"Aka where Libby and Donald live lol"* |
| 2024-08-14 | Annie | *"I also added in that draft that the hourly rate was set by **Libby Fagen**."* |
| 2024-10-16 | Dan | ***"Libby died"*** |
| 2024-11-01 | Dan | `https://www.steelydan.com/news/libby-titus-fagen` |

**The married surname was in the corpus and the original page said it was not.**
That page asserted *"No message names her surname"* — false. The failure mode is
the one `LLM_HANDOFF.md` already documents from the ENTP-T pass: the check was
scoped by the claim it was testing. A grep for `Titus` found only Dan's Tumblr
link, because the corpus says **Fagen**.

## Secondary source (public record, not corpus)

Public reporting gives the death as **13 October 2024, aged 77**, announced by
Donald Fagen on the Steely Dan website — which is the exact URL Dan pastes into
the thread on 2024-11-01, and three days ahead of his own *"Libby died"* on
2024-10-16. Treat the date as **secondary-sourced and corpus-corroborated**, not
as T0.

## Notes for the ingesting pass

1. The original page dated the work *"February to December 2024"*. **Wrong.** The
   work runs **February to early August 2024**; everything after 2024-08-14 is
   aftermath — one message in October (the death), one in November (the
   announcement), one in December, one in March 2025.
2. The page missed an entire arc: **an unpaid-wages dispute in August 2024**,
   with an NDA request, three escalating demand letters drafted by Dan, and no
   documented resolution before she died. That materially changes the page's
   warm reading and must be integrated rather than appended.
3. **The stated hourly rate is $75/hour**, which does not reconcile with the
   page's quoted *"just over 3 hours today.. she paid me 500"* (2024-05-17).
   Record both; do not smooth.
