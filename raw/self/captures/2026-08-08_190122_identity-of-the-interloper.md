# Identity of the Interloper

i finally decided it was time to unmask the interloper and gather as much data as i could. here's everything available on FOREWARN:



 * Name: Jerel Wayne Coles
 * Age: 36
 * Primary Address: 106 Nassau St, Uniontown, PA 15401

⚖ Possible Criminal / Infraction Records (Stronger Matches) — 64 Found
 * Record 1: Jerel W Coles

   * Match Key Criteria Met: First name, Last name, Middle initial, Birth date, City, State, Proximity
Yep — this is **64 database records, but nowhere near 64 separate incidents**. The records are heavily duplicated across PA court-data sources and across different stages of the same cases.

## Cleaned-up chronology

### **2008**

**Nov. 20, 2008 — Disorderly conduct**

* Disorderly conduct — engaging in fighting
* **Guilty plea**

**Oct. 31, 2008 — Traffic**

* Turning movements / required signal
* Disposition unavailable

### **2009**

**June 13, 2009 — Vehicle equipment**

* Remove/render inoperative registered equipment
* **Guilty plea**
* Appears twice in the dataset (records 49 & 52), almost certainly duplicate representations.

**July 19, 2009 — Harassment**

* Harassment — subject another person to physical contact
* **Guilty**

### **2010**

**June 6, 2010 — Traffic stop**

* License expired — **Guilty**
* Obedience to traffic-control devices — **Guilty plea**

**July 7, 2010 — Traffic**

* Operating vehicle without valid inspection — **Not guilty**
* Obstructed window — **Guilty plea**

Again, several records are duplicate disposition/case representations.

# 2019: First DUI

### **February 3, 2019**

This appears to be **one traffic/DUI incident with multiple charges**:

* DUI — general impairment / incapable of safely driving
* DUI — **highest rate of alcohol, BAC .16+**
* Obedience to traffic-control devices
* Disregard traffic lane
* Duties at stop sign
* Careless driving

The DUI and several associated charges show **ARD — County**.

The same group also appears as citations **waived for court**.

### What matters here

This is not six separate DUI incidents.

It looks like:

> **ONE February 3, 2019 incident → multiple criminal/traffic charges → ARD disposition**

And importantly, the record specifically describes the aggravated alcohol charge as **BAC .16+**.

---

# 2024: Second DUI

### **June 29, 2024**

This is the other major cluster.

Again, it appears to be **one incident with five charges**:

* DUI — general impairment / incapable of safely driving
* Improper left turn
* Failure to stop at red signal
* Turning movements / required signal
* Operating vehicle without valid inspection

The records show the case moving through several stages:

**Oct. 8, 2024**

* DUI — waived for court
* Turning/signaling — waived for court
* Vehicle inspection — waived for court

**Jan. 22, 2025**

* DUI
* Improper left turn
* Failure to stop at red signal
* Turning/signaling
* Vehicle inspection

Several records say **"Proceed to Court."**

Then the Court of Common Pleas records ultimately show:

* DUI — **Guilty plea**
* Improper left turn — **Guilty plea**
* Failure to stop at red signal — **Guilty plea**
* Turning movements/signaling — **Guilty plea**
* Vehicle inspection — **Guilty plea**

So the clean interpretation is:

> **June 29, 2024 DUI/traffic incident → five charges → ultimately guilty pleas on all five listed charges.**

The 2024 cluster alone accounts for a huge percentage of the 64 records because the same charges are represented in multiple databases and procedural stages.

---

# 2025: Criminal mischief

### **April 5, 2025**

* **Criminal mischief — damage property**
* Charges filed **May 6, 2025**
* Disposition unavailable

This appears to be a **new, non-traffic criminal matter**, separate from the 2024 DUI case.

There are two records for it, but they appear to represent the same charge in two court-data sources.

---

# The actual incident count

If we collapse obvious duplicates and group charges by offense date, I get approximately:

| Date       | Incident                          | Charges | Apparent outcome                |
| ---------- | --------------------------------- | ------: | ------------------------------- |
| 10/31/2008 | Traffic                           |       1 | Unknown                         |
| 11/20/2008 | Disorderly conduct/fighting       |       1 | **Guilty plea**                 |
| 06/13/2009 | Vehicle equipment                 |       1 | **Guilty plea**                 |
| 07/19/2009 | Harassment/physical contact       |       1 | **Guilty**                      |
| 06/06/2010 | Traffic                           |       2 | **Guilty / guilty plea**        |
| 07/07/2010 | Traffic                           |       2 | **1 guilty plea, 1 not guilty** |
| 02/03/2019 | DUI + traffic                     |       6 | **ARD County**                  |
| 06/29/2024 | DUI + traffic                     |       5 | **Guilty pleas**                |
| 04/05/2025 | Criminal mischief/property damage |       1 | **Unknown**                     |

So we're looking at roughly **9 identifiable incident clusters**, producing around **20 distinct charges**, rather than 64 offenses.

## The striking pattern

There is a pretty clear longitudinal pattern here:

**2008–2010:**
Mostly ordinary traffic violations, plus two relatively minor interpersonal/public-order offenses:

* fighting/disorderly conduct
* harassment involving physical contact

**2019:**
First documented DUI, specifically including a **BAC ≥ .16 charge**, plus multiple traffic violations. The case appears to have gone through **ARD** rather than ending in a conventional conviction.

**2024:**
Second documented DUI, again accompanied by a constellation of traffic violations. This one ultimately shows **guilty pleas**.

**2025:**
A move outside the traffic/DUI pattern into **criminal mischief involving property damage**.

### One important caveat

I would **not** describe this as "64 criminal convictions" or even "64 offenses." That would be wildly misleading. The dataset is essentially showing the same underlying cases repeatedly through:

* PA Administrative Office of Courts
* PA Unified Judicial System
* Court of Common Pleas
* original citation
* court processing
* disposition

The **2024 DUI cluster alone appears 5 charges × several database/procedural representations**, which is why the raw count explodes.

The much more defensible summary is:

> **A documented history spanning 2008–2025, with multiple traffic violations, two DUI incidents (2019 and 2024), earlier disorderly-conduct/harassment matters, and a 2025 criminal-mischief/property-damage charge. The 2019 DUI appears to have resulted in county ARD; the 2024 DUI and associated traffic charges show guilty pleas; the 2025 criminal-mischief matter has no disposition in the supplied data.**
