# Factstory Brief Template — the instruction block that ships with captures

**This file is the source of truth for the INGEST BRIEF that
`leviathan/factstory.html` emits with each batch of hand-typed facts and
stories.** The generator in the other repository must be regenerated from this
file whenever it changes; otherwise offline ingests drift away from in-repo
ones, which is the exact failure the brief exists to prevent.

Everything between the rules below is what gets pasted above the payload. The
payload itself (`## N. THE PAYLOAD`) is generated per batch and is not
templated here.

**Revision history of the instructions themselves:**

| Date | Change |
|---|---|
| 2026-08-01 | STRATEGY.md's core loop, coverage rule and live-node doctrine propagated in |
| 2026-08-02 | Sections 2.5, 5.2b and 6 rewritten after the brief-#4 ingest: captures are testimony to be checked, not facts to be recorded; verification is a required step, not a courtesy; a reasoned non-climb is a finished climb |

## 0. What this file is, and what you are being asked to do

You are being handed facts and stories that a person typed by hand. **They
exist in no export, no message log and no archive anywhere**, because they were
only ever said out loud. Everything below the payload marker is the payload;
everything above it is your instructions.

Your job, end to end:

1. Read the existing wiki so you write *into* a graph rather than beside it.
2. File each capture verbatim into `raw/` so every claim has provenance.
3. **Check the capture against the corpus before you write a word of prose.**
4. Write or revise the `wiki/` pages the captures touch — as prose, not notes.
5. Wire them in with typed edges carrying argued claims, **both directions**.
6. **Write any finding back into every entry it draws from.**
7. Append to `log.md`, update indexes and `queue.md`.
8. Open a pull request against `main`.

**This is a second brain, not a note pile.** A fact filed is worth little; a
connection argued is the product. If you finish and have only added text without
adding a single typed edge, you have not done the job.

### The core loop you are one turn of

**Story → Entry → Analysis → Synthesized finding → saved back to every entry it
touches → repeat.**

The repository calls this **amortized insight**: analysis is expensive to do
well, so it is done once, saved at every point where it is relevant, and every
future pass starts from a higher floor instead of re-deriving what is already
known.

Two consequences bind you directly:

- **Every data point gets an entry.** Every story, friend, place, perspective,
  development and thought. Thinness is not a reason to withhold a page — a stub
  marked `status: stub` beats a fact that lives nowhere. (One exception:
  `wiki/people/contacts/` is quarantine for unverified auto-generated handles.
  Do not add there.)
- **An entry is a live node, not a record.** Each page carries what was known at
  ingestion *and* everything later produced by using it in analysis against the
  rest of the corpus. If you conclude something about a page, that conclusion
  belongs **on** it.

> **The one thing that would make this worse than doing nothing:** inventing
> detail. Everything you write must trace to one of these captures, to the
> corpus, or to a page already in the wiki. Where you are inferring rather than
> recording, say so in the text. Where you do not know, write a Gaps line. An
> honest gap is an asset; a confident fabrication corrupts every conclusion
> built on it later.

## 1. Orient — read the existing wiki first (it is publicly readable)

You do **not** need repo access to read the current wiki. It is published as
plain text:

| What | URL |
|---|---|
| Discovery | `https://caakehorn.github.io/wiki-brain/llms.txt` |
| Machine index (every page + metadata) | `https://caakehorn.github.io/wiki-brain/agent/manifest.json` |
| Critical spine (start here if context is tight) | `https://caakehorn.github.io/wiki-brain/agent/critical.md` |
| One domain at a time | `https://caakehorn.github.io/wiki-brain/agent/domains/<domain>.md` |
| Whole corpus | `https://caakehorn.github.io/wiki-brain/agent/corpus.md` |
| A single page | `https://caakehorn.github.io/wiki-brain/wiki/<path>.md` |
| Plain-text mirror | `https://caakehorn.github.io/wiki-brain/llm/index.txt` |

Domains: `self` · `timeline` · `people` · `mind` · `work` · `interests` ·
`health` · `places` · `legal`

The single most authoritative page is `wiki/self/context-core.md`. Where it and
anything else disagree, it wins unless the other carries a specific dated
correction.

**If you have no web access:** say so plainly at the top of your output, then
write only *new* pages and do not claim to revise existing ones — you cannot
revise a page you have not read, and guessing at its current contents will
destroy earned work.

## 2. The rules you must not break

1. **Never write an untyped link.** Every connection gets a `type` from the
   §4 vocabulary and a `claim` sentence. If you cannot write the claim, do not
   make the connection.
2. **Never state a fact without a source that exists on disk.** A dangling
   `sources:` entry is a lint error.
3. **One page per entity.** Before creating a `people/` page, search the
   manifest for the person under every name, nickname and handle in the
   capture. Merge, never fork.
4. **Contradictions are flagged, not overwritten.**
   `> **CONTRADICTION:** <what the page says> vs <what the capture says>.`
   Revisions get `> **REVISED [YYYY-MM-DD]:** …`. **Never delete an existing
   conclusion because new material disagrees with it** — the disagreement is
   the valuable part.
5. **Revise, never regenerate.** Pages marked `knowledge: earned` are the
   product of reasoning done once and are not reproducible from source
   material. Edit them surgically.
6. **Complete sentences.** Every page must read as prose to a stranger opening
   it cold. No fragment chains, no dossier shorthand, no bullet soup.
7. **Tables hold numbers, prose holds meaning.** Never restate a table in prose.
8. **Dates are absolute.** Convert "last summer" to a year and flag uncertainty
   as `(~2019?)`. Never leave a relative date in a page. **And see §2.5 — an
   absolute date in a capture is not automatically the right one.**
9. **Paraphrase into `wiki/`, keep verbatim in `raw/`.** Quote a sentence or
   less only where the exact wording is itself the evidence.
10. **No session chatter in `wiki/`.** No "I have added…", no notes to the
    operator. That belongs in `log.md`.
11. **Never leave a finding on one page.** If a conclusion draws on three
    pages, all three carry it.

## 2.5 A capture is testimony, not fact *(added 2026-08-02)*

**This is the section most likely to change what you produce.** The person who
typed these entries is recounting from memory, sometimes years later, sometimes
about the worst nights of their life. The memories are the point — nothing else
in the corpus has them. The *dates and figures attached to them are the least
reliable part*, and the corpus can usually settle them.

The brief-#4 batch is the standing example. Two long, vivid, internally
consistent stories dated a sequence to **March–April 2017**. Seven independent
records — a GEDCOM death date, two caregivers' dated message threads, an
eviction notice, two condolence messages, and the participant's own thread —
dated it to **2018**. The operator was wrong by exactly one year about the
death of the person he describes as his single biggest life influence. That is
not unusual and it is not a criticism; it is what memory does. What matters is
that the model checked.

So, before writing prose:

- **Take every date, age, duration and count in the capture as a claim to be
  tested.** Search the corpus for the events around it.
- **The strongest corroboration is internal to the story.** In the example
  above, the decisive evidence was not the death certificate — it was that the
  third party the story turns on has no contact with Dan in the corpus until
  eleven months after the story says the encounter happened. Find the row that
  is *inside* the narrative.
- **When the capture and the corpus disagree, both go on the page.** Table the
  evidence, state which governs and why, and — separately and labelled as
  inference — say why the memory may have slipped if you can see a mechanism.
- **When the capture is right and the corpus was vague, say so loudly.** The
  same batch had the operator write "died in early 2017 from a heroin overdose.
  Date of death should be researched" — and the corpus produced the day, the
  hour, four recipients, the viewing and the funeral. That is the system
  working.

## 3. Frontmatter — every page carries exactly this shape

```yaml
---
domain: self | timeline | people | mind | work | interests | health | places | legal
page_type: entity | event | concept | period | summary | synthesis | profile | report | chat | note | index
status: active | stable | stub | closed | archived
date_created: YYYY-MM-DD
date_modified: YYYY-MM-DD
sources:              # paths under raw/ ONLY, and they must exist
  - raw/<domain>/captures/<the file you created>.md
tags: [topic, topic]  # closed vocabulary — see STYLE_GUIDE.md, do not invent
connections:          # see §4 — this is the important one
  - page: wiki/people/someone
    type: causes
    claim: "One complete sentence a stranger could evaluate and try to falsify."
---
```

Optional, use where they earn their place: `title:`, `aliases: []`,
`importance: critical|high|normal`, `knowledge: earned|derived|mixed`.

**`status` means what it says.** `closed` means a thing has formally *ended*,
not that the page feels finished. Default for a finished page is `stable`.

**Every `domain: people` page must also carry an `infobox:` block** with at
least `name` and `relationship_to_dan`.

**`sources:` is for `raw/` paths. `synthesizes:` is for `wiki/` paths.**

## 4. Typed edges — the vocabulary, and the inverse rule

A connection records **how** two pages relate, not that they do.

**Directional — you must write the inverse edge on the target page:**

| type | inverse | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `causes` | `caused-by` | A is a documented cause or driver of B |
| `evidences` | `evidenced-by` | A is primary evidence for the claim B makes |
| `instantiates` | `instance-of` | A is a concrete case of pattern/concept B |
| `precedes` | `follows` | temporal or causal sequence |
| `supplies` | `supplied-by` | material or logistical dependency |
| `component-of` | `contains` | part / whole |

**Symmetric — same type on both pages:**

| type | meaning |
|---|---|
| `contradicts` | incompatible claims — **must** also carry a `> **CONTRADICTION:**` block |
| `parallels` | same structure in different domains or eras — **the highest-value type** |
| `mirrors` | inverted or complementary structure |
| `co-occurs` | documented joint presence, no causation asserted — the weakest legal type |

**Directional, no inverse required:** `escalates`, `resolves`, `contextualizes`.

- **Invent no types.** Anything outside these tables fails validation.
- **The type is the analytical commitment.** `co-occurs` where the evidence
  supports `causes` is a substance failure; `causes` where it only supports
  `co-occurs` is a provenance failure.
- **Pair your types correctly.** `instantiates` pairs with `instance-of`;
  `contains` pairs with `component-of`. Writing `instantiates` on one side and
  `contains` on the other leaves *neither* side with an inverse and the checker
  warns on both.
- **3–10 connections per page.** More usually means a synthesis page is missing.
- **Any `causes`, `contradicts`, `instantiates` or `parallels` edge must also
  be argued in the body prose** of at least one of the two pages.
- **A new page with no inbound `[[wikilink]]` from existing prose is an
  orphan.** Always add at least one prose mention on a page that already exists.

### The inverse claim has to carry the finding

When you conclude something across several pages, the claim you write back onto
each of them must state **what that page turned out to be evidence of** — not
that a relationship exists.

The test: a reader who lands on the member page and reads only its
`connections:` block should come away with the conclusion itself.

```yaml
# FAILS — names a relationship, transmits nothing
- page: wiki/mind/synthesis/some-finding
  type: instantiates
  claim: "This page is one of the members of the some-finding synthesis."

# PASSES — the finding itself, readable cold, at the point of arrival
- page: wiki/mind/synthesis/some-finding
  type: instantiates
  claim: "Seventeen years of continuous presence after the 2009 breakup is the cleanest case of a romantic role ending without the tie ending."
```

## 5. Procedure — do this in order

### 5.1 File every capture into `raw/` first

For each payload entry, create **one file**, verbatim, at
`raw/<domain>/captures/<suggested raw filename from the entry table>`. The file
is the entry's metadata header followed by its verbatim text — do not clean it
up, do not paraphrase, do not correct its grammar or its dates. `raw/` is
immutable source and its whole value is being untouched.

### 5.2 Decide the target pages

- If the entry declares a **target**, that page is authoritative — apply the
  capture there first, then propagate.
- Otherwise search for every person, place, event, employer and concept the
  capture names. Prefer **revising an existing page** over creating a new one.
- A single capture usually touches **three or more** pages. Ingesting it into
  one page and stopping is the most common failure.

### 5.2b Follow every proper noun into the corpus *(added 2026-08-02)*

Do not treat the capture as the boundary of the work. For each name, place and
institution it mentions, search `raw/` before writing — including the sources
nobody has re-read in months, like the genealogy export and the full message
dump.

This is where the compounding actually happens, and the cost is low. In the
brief-#4 batch, one throwaway clause — a hostile aside naming a grandmother —
was followed into the GEDCOM's family records and produced three results no
capture contained: two gaps that a page had explicitly named were closed
(a maiden name, a first husband), a person with no page got one, and the
repository's family tree turned out to have run the maternal line through the
wrong grandparent for six weeks. None of that is in the capture. All of it was
one search away.

**Also check whether the capture answers a gap somebody already wrote down.**
Pages end with Gaps paragraphs naming exactly what is unknown. Grep them. When
a capture closes one, mark it on the page as a closure with the date — that is
the cheapest high-value edit available and it is how the wiki demonstrates it
is accumulating rather than accreting.

### 5.3 Write

The first paragraph must answer the stranger's question — for a person: who is
this to Dan, what is the current state, what is the defining thing; for an
event: what happened and what changed. **Order by consequence, not chronology.**
State load-bearing conclusions plainly. Put dates and counts in tables. End with
a **Gaps** paragraph naming what is still unknown.

When you add to an existing page, integrate the material into the prose where it
belongs. Do not append a dated "New information" section at the bottom — that is
how pages rot into changelogs.

### 5.4 Wire it

Add the typed edges per §4, **including the inverse on every target page**, and
at least one prose `[[wikilink]]` for each load-bearing edge. Bump
`date_modified` on every page you touched.

Then do the step that is easy to skip: **if this ingest produced a finding
spanning several pages, write that finding back into each of them** as a claim
stating what that page turned out to be evidence of.

### 5.5 Log it

Append to `log.md` — newest at the bottom, never edit existing entries:

```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD] ingest | <domain> | factstory capture — <short description>
<What came in, which pages it changed, what it settled, what it corrected, what
it opened, and what you were unsure about. This log is where uncertainty is
allowed to live — name it here rather than smoothing it into the pages.>
```

### 5.6 Update the indexes and the queue

If you created any page, add it to its domain index (`wiki/<domain>/index.md`)
as a link plus a one-line summary. Indexes are navigation only. Record the batch
in `queue.md`, including anything the corpus cannot answer and a human would
have to look up elsewhere.

## 6. Climbing — and the reasoned refusal that counts as one

If these captures make you notice **the same shape across three or more pages
spanning two or more domains**, and nothing in the wiki already states it, you
may have a synthesis.

The test is strict: *can you write one sentence that is true of every member, is
**not** true of the corpus generally, and that a stranger could try to falsify?*
A page whose thesis is "these things are related" is worse than no page.

If you can, it carries: `page_type: synthesis`, `knowledge: earned`, a
`synthesizes:` list naming every member, the thesis in the first two sentences,
a table of members against the rule, the counterexample or control that makes it
a claim rather than a mood, **at least one falsifiable prediction**, and a Gaps
section. Each member gets an `instantiates` edge carrying the finding back.

**But an unclimbed cluster, written down properly, is a completed piece of work
— not a failure** *(2026-08-02)*. Do not climb onto pages you created in the
same pass: a synthesis resting on a concept page written that afternoon is the
write-only anti-pattern with extra steps, and CLAUDE.md's rule is to climb after
a cluster has survived two or more ingests. When you find a real cluster you
should not yet climb, register it in `synthesis-queue.md` with three things:

1. the member pages and their domains,
2. the candidate sentence, stated so the next model can attack it, and
3. **the specific, cheap piece of work that would earn the climb** — the audit,
   the count, the falsifier to go looking for.

That entry is worth more than a thin synthesis page, and the next pass starts
from it. Do not climb to raise a number. Three thin pages stacked make one thin
page.

## 7. Output format

Think out loud first if it helps — everything outside these blocks is ignored.
Then emit **complete files, never diffs**:

```
===FILE: wiki/people/example.md===
<the entire new content of the file, frontmatter included>
===END===

===FILE: raw/self/captures/2026-01-01_120000_example.md===
<the verbatim capture>
===END===

===LOG: ingest | <domain> | factstory capture — <one line>===

===COMMIT: ingest: <short description>===
```

Any number of `FILE` blocks; exactly one `LOG` and one `COMMIT`. For a page you
are *revising*, the `FILE` block must contain the **whole page**. If you cannot
reproduce a page in full because you could not read it, do not emit a `FILE`
block for it — describe the change you wanted and let a human apply it.

If the repository is checked out locally, `bin/ingest-apply <your-response>.md`
validates and applies this format directly.

## 8. Getting it into a pull request

Use the first route available to you.

**Route A — a terminal with the repo cloned**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/caakehorn/wiki-brain && cd wiki-brain
git checkout -b factstory/<YYYY-MM-DD>-manual-captures
# save the model response to response.md, then:
bin/ingest-apply response.md
bin/wiki-lint && bin/wiki-connect check && bin/wiki-climb check   # all must be 0 errors
git add -A && git commit -m "ingest: factstory manual captures"
git push -u origin HEAD
```

**Route B — browser only, no terminal.** Open the repo, press `.` for the
browser editor, create each file at its path, and on the **first** file choose
"Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request," naming the
branch `factstory/<YYYY-MM-DD>-manual-captures`. Commit every subsequent file
to that same branch. Append the `LOG` entry to the bottom of `log.md`. Open the
PR, titled with the `COMMIT` line.

**Do not commit to `main` directly.** The point of the branch is that a human
reads the diff before it becomes truth.

## 9. Pre-flight checklist

Three validators (`bin/wiki-lint`, `bin/wiki-connect check`,
`bin/wiki-climb check`) must report **0 errors**. If you cannot run them, check
by hand:

- [ ] Every `sources:` path exists — i.e. you emitted a `FILE` block creating it.
- [ ] No `wiki/` path in `sources:`; no `raw/` path in `synthesizes:`.
- [ ] Every `connections:` entry has a `page`, a `type` from §4, and a `claim`
      that is a complete sentence of at least 25 characters.
- [ ] Every directional edge has its **correctly paired** inverse on the target.
- [ ] Every inverse claim carrying a finding **states the finding**.
- [ ] **Every date in every capture was checked against the corpus** (§2.5), and
      any disagreement is tabled on the page rather than silently resolved.
- [ ] **Every proper noun in every capture was searched for in `raw/`** (§5.2b).
- [ ] Any page Gaps paragraph this batch answers is marked closed, with a date.
- [ ] Every `[[wikilink]]` points at a page that exists or that you are creating.
- [ ] Every new page has at least one inbound `[[wikilink]]` from existing prose.
- [ ] Every page you touched has `date_modified` bumped to today.
- [ ] `page_type`, `status`, `domain` and every `tag` are values from the
      controlled vocabularies, spelled exactly.
- [ ] Every `domain: people` page carries an `infobox:` block.
- [ ] No relative dates and no agent chatter anywhere in `wiki/`.
- [ ] `log.md` appended, not edited; `queue.md` updated.

Then, in the PR body, state plainly: what you added, what you **corrected**,
what you inferred rather than recorded, what you could not verify, and anything
you decided **not** to do. That last one matters most — the operator needs to
know where you stopped.
