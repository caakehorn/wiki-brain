# Write to the source, never to the surface it generates

## Instruction

Before editing any file, establish whether it is a source or a derivation of one.

1. If the file is generated, edit the thing it is generated *from*, then rerun the
   generator. `DIGEST.md`, `RECENT.md`, `OPEN.md`, `wiki/meta/*`, `llm/**`,
   `WORK.md`, `skills/INDEX.md` and `intake/units.json` are all derivations.
2. If you are editing a wiki page as JSON, stop — you are in the portal
   repository. Pages are `wiki/**.md`, in wiki-brain.
3. Never hand-edit `public/wiki/**` in `caakehorn/home`. It is deleted and
   rebuilt from this repository on dispatch and hourly.
4. After a content pass, run the generators before committing. `bin/wiki-check`
   does this in the correct order — generate, then gate, then scan.

## Why

A derived file accepts an edit exactly as readily as a source does, and then
discards it on a schedule. The failure is silent, delayed, and looks like nothing
happened: on 2026-08-17 a December 2015 read pass was written into the portal's
derived snapshot, merged, and deleted by the rebuild cron 39 minutes later. A
second pass of the same work was written into the snapshot as well. The work was
real; the surface it was written to was not the record.

The mirror image is drift: a source edited without rerunning its generator leaves
the derivation stale while every gate stays green. The 2026-08-20 audit found
`llm/manifest.json` eleven pages behind `wiki/` for that reason.

## Validation

`bin/wiki-freshness` compares the generated corpus against `wiki/` and names
every page missing, orphaned or changed; `bin/wiki-check --check-only` answers
the reviewer's question — is what is committed already consistent — without
writing anything. For a portal-visible change, confirm the page is live on the
site, not merely that the commit merged.

## Known limits

`wiki/**/archive/` is pinned and exempt. A generated file may be edited when the
change is to the generator's *output format* and the generator is edited in the
same commit — the rule is against edits the next run will silently discard, not
against touching the file at all.
