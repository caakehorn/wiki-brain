# Never clear a staleness warning by bumping the date

## Instruction

When a gate reports that a page's premise moved under it:

1. Read what actually changed in the premise — `git log -p` on the member page,
   not just its new date.
2. Decide whether the conclusion survives the change.
3. Write the decision down on the dependent page: the conclusion stands, is
   narrowed, or is retracted, and why.
4. Only then update the recorded date, as a record of the re-reading you did.

Do not touch `source_modified:`, `date_modified:` or a `synthesizes:` date before
step 2 has actually happened.

## Why

The date field is not the thing being checked; it is the receipt for a check.
Bumping it is the one move in this repository that corrupts the system quietly —
it converts a true warning into a false all-clear, and no later gate can tell the
difference, because the evidence that a re-reading was skipped is exactly the
field that was overwritten.

It compounds where it is cheapest to do. A stale Reader's Digest twin cleared by
a date bump is a confident, readable, wrong account of what the wiki says, served
to the one reader who cannot check it against anything.

## Validation

The dependent page carries a dated line stating what moved and what happened to
the conclusion. `bin/wiki-climb check` and `bin/wiki-plain check` return to 0
errors because the premise was re-read, and a reviewer reading the diff can see
the reasoning, not only the changed date.

## Known limits

A premise change that is purely mechanical — a typo fix, a link repair, a
reformat with no claim touched — needs the re-read but produces no prose: record
that in the commit message rather than on the page.
