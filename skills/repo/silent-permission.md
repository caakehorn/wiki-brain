# A guard that fails open leaves no trace, so it has to be tested against the corpus it guards

## Instruction

1. **Ask what the guard reads, then ask how often that field is absent.** A
   check keyed on `title:` looks total and is not: **288 of 497 pages here carry
   no `title:` field at all.** Resolve the subject the way the rest of the file
   already resolves it — in this repository that means `title_of()`, which falls
   back to `infobox.name` and then to the slug.
2. **Write the test in both directions.** A test that only asserts the refusal
   is satisfied by a guard that refuses everything, which is its own failure —
   `bin/wiki-crosslink`'s guard is deliberately narrower than `bin/wiki-plain`'s
   because porting the wider rule across would withhold 197 of 497 pages for no
   safety gained. Assert what it refuses **and** what it must not.
3. **Pin the real pages, not only synthetic ones.** The synthetic cases pass
   against a guard that has never met the corpus. `MoratoriumNameResolution`
   names all nine pages that were exposed, so the hole cannot reopen quietly.
4. **Check every enforcement point, not the one you are in.** The same directive
   is enforced in two files here and both shipped with a hole of this shape.
   Finding one is a reason to go and read the other.
5. **A guard's blind spot is found by measuring, not by reading it.** Both holes
   were found by accident — one by hand-checking a translation, one because a
   frontmatter sweep touched a page and nothing fired. Neither was found by
   looking at the code, and the code looked correct both times.

## Why

**Every other check in this repository fails closed.** `bin/wiki-lint` goes red,
`bin/wiki-plain check` blocks a commit, `bin/wiki-climb check` prints a warning
somebody eventually reads. A guard that refuses is the opposite: when it is
wrong it **permits**, and permission produces no output, no exit code and no
warning. The only evidence is the thing it should have stopped, happening
normally.

Two instances, both on the standing directive in `CLAUDE.md`, in two different
tools, neither found deliberately:

| Tool | What it read | What it missed |
|---|---|---|
| `bin/wiki-plain` | `\bannie\b` | `_` is a word character, so the trailing boundary fails against `annie_metadata_24h.csv` — the filename that material is cited by throughout. A page carrying it twice read as ELIGIBLE FOR TRANSLATION. |
| `bin/wiki-crosslink` | `scalar(fm, "title")` + aliases | 288 pages have no `title:`. **Nine pages were invisible**, including `wiki/timeline/annie-record`, `wiki/people/ellen-ulmer` and `wiki/timeline/events/shelbie-annie-threesome-april-2019` — pages squarely about her, which `scan` would have accepted as subjects and offered as targets to write edges onto. |

The second one is worse than it looks, because `bin/wiki-crosslink`'s whole
output is a worklist. A candidate list that includes her page is an instruction
to write about her, in the column nobody was checking: the guard was enforced on
the page being scanned and not on the pages being *offered*, which is the same
defect from a third angle and was fixed the same day.

**The measurement that would have found either one takes a minute.** For the
second: `288 of 497 pages have no title:` is one loop over the corpus, and it
makes the hole obvious the moment anybody asks what the guard reads.

## Validation

`python3 -m unittest tests.test_wiki_crosslink.MoratoriumNameResolution` — five
cases, including a regression that names all nine exposed pages against the real
corpus. Removing the `title_of()` resolution fails it.
`tests/test_wiki_plain.py` pins the other instance.

Broader check, for a guard anywhere in this repository: count how many pages
lack the field the guard reads. If the answer is not zero, the guard has a blind
spot the size of that number.

## Known limits

**This says nothing about whether the rule is right, only whether it runs.** The
narrowness of `bin/wiki-crosslink`'s threshold against `bin/wiki-plain`'s is a
judgment about what the directive actually forbids, measured at 197 pages, and
no test can settle it — only the operator can.

**It does not generalise to checks that fail closed.** A gate that goes red when
it is wrong announces itself and does not need this treatment; the cost of a
false positive there is an annoyed session, not a silent breach.
