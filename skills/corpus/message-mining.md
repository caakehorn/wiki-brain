# Mine the message corpus with the instruments, not with grep

## Instruction

1. To find or count messages, use `bin/mine-messages` (`stats`, `grep`,
   `timeline`, `battery`, `entities`). Do not use shell `grep` over the export.
2. For any claim about **length or cadence** — how much he writes, how fast he
   answers, how his style moved — use `bin/text-metrics`, not `mine-messages`.
3. Re-derive every number at the point you cite it. Do not copy a figure forward
   from another page.
4. Quote the figure with what produced it, so the next agent can re-run it.

## Why

Three properties of the dump make naive `grep` quietly wrong — it splits one
message across several lines and miscounts, among others — and quietly wrong is
the failure that matters, because the number still looks like evidence.

The unit error is worse, because it inverts the finding rather than blurring it.
`mine-messages` counts messages, and 98% of Dan's messages are one line with a
median of 6 words, so a message-level read makes him look unremarkable. The unit
that corresponds to one thing said is the **turn**. Measured that way he runs
3.05x his interlocutors' words in 2026 against 1.23x in 2015–19 — the entire
effect the page exists to document, invisible at the wrong unit.

## Validation

The command that produced the figure is named next to it and re-runs to the same
number. A style claim cites `bin/text-metrics`; a volume or occurrence claim
cites `bin/mine-messages`.

## Known limits

`bin/text-metrics` defaults to `imessage_export_deep_20260813.csv`, the only
sender-tagged export reaching past 2025; a question about an earlier period may
need a different source named explicitly. Neither tool may be pointed at the
Annie corpus for new material — that is closed under the standing moratorium in
`CLAUDE.md`, which outranks this skill.
