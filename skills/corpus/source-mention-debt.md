# A source's debt to the pages it did not get written onto is invisible from both ends

## Instruction

1. **After writing a page from a corpus, run `bin/wiki-crosslink scan <page>`**
   before considering the source worked. It reads the corpora the page's own
   `sources:` name, inside the page's own date range, and lists entities that
   have pages the page does not link.
2. **Read the rows it prints. Every one.** Roughly every single-token name
   match is a false positive — this pass got Rick Santorum under "Rick", Tom
   Cruise under "Tom", Jack Ü under "Jack" and slim jims under "slim". The tool
   emits candidates; the edge comes from reading.
3. **Go at the target page's claims about itself first.** Sort the candidates
   by whether the target asserts something checkable about its own
   completeness or limits. That is where the value is concentrated and it is
   not close.
4. **Write the edge even when there is no finding.** A mention is an
   obligation on its own: the target page's evidence base is short and it has
   no way to discover that. The claim states what the target did not have, not
   that a mention exists.
5. **Run `bin/wiki-crosslink reciprocal` before committing.** An edge whose
   target never got told is half an edge. An edge into a generated page is not
   debt and the tool already knows the list.
6. **Say what did not survive the wider match.** A pattern found on the first
   handful of pairs is a hypothesis; extend the match before writing it, and
   when it dissolves, put the dissolution on the page.

## Why

**This is the only obligation in the repository with no symptom.** A red gate
announces itself, a parked `sage/` question sits at priority 1 in
`bin/wiki-work`, a stale premise fires a warning. A source that named forty
things and got linked to three is indistinguishable — from the page, from
`WORK.md`, from `bin/wiki-lint` — from a source that named three. The page
reads as finished because it *is* finished. What is unfinished is on pages
nobody is looking at, and those pages cannot report a gap they have no
mechanism to detect.

The measured case, 2026-09-04. Nineteen `wiki/self/twitter/` year pages had
been written across two sessions by reading every tweet in every year, to a
high standard, carrying 130 typed edges. A scan of the same archive against
the same pages found the pages had never been told about:

| Page | What it was missing | What the page said about itself |
|---|---|---|
| `interests/concert-record/index` | three Orlando concerts, four corroborations | *"the master table below is the complete record"* |
| `people/katie-fletcher` | six dated posts, a handle, a Vine from inside the event it narrates | *"everything known arrives through Dan's later AI-session narration"* |
| `health/chemical-architecture` | eighteen years of dated nicotine evidence and an onset year | the row *"has no ledger entries at all and remains description"* |
| `interests/music/aliases/sloppp` | 20 more 2013 releases; 16 in one month against a table showing 1 | discography *"reconstructed from posted links"* |

**Every one of those pages stated its own limit, and the limit was wrong.** A
page that says what it does not know is telling you where to point the next
source — and it will keep saying it, indefinitely, because nothing else will
ever check.

The 39 one-way edges found the same day are the same defect from the other
side: the finding was written where it was discovered and the page it was
about never heard.

## Validation

`bin/wiki-crosslink scan <page>` on a page you have just finished. If it names
targets you did not consider, the source was not worked out. `bin/wiki-crosslink
reciprocal <prefix>` must reach 0 for the tree you touched; `bin/wiki-crosslink
check` prints the repository-wide total and always exits 0 by design, because a
gate that blocked unrelated commits on a one-way edge would acquire an escape
hatch and stop being a gate.

## Known limits

**The scan can only look for names somebody already wrote a page for.** Entities
with no page are exactly the ones it cannot see, and finding those is
`EXTRACTION_SPEC.md` move 3, done by reading. The two moves are complementary
and neither substitutes for the other.

**It finds no conceptual link at all.** Everything above is string matching over
proper nouns. A tweet that is evidence for a synthesis without naming anything
— which is most of the interesting ones — is invisible to it, and the operator's
original ask was explicitly for those. This skill covers the mechanical half
only; the conceptual half is a reading job and always will be.

**It only reads corpora it has a reader for.** `CORPORA` in `bin/wiki-crosslink`
holds three entries as of 2026-09-04 — the twitter archive and both message
exports, the latter two by importing `bin/mine-messages`' reader rather than
writing a second one, which is the only way to inherit that file's three traps
instead of its interface. The Facebook export, the YouTube history, the Gemini
activity, the concert table and the favorites list are all still unread, and
`wiki/interests/music/overview` carries absence claims derived from the message
corpus that have never been checked either way.

**The right scope depends on the corpus.** `--against` reads the rows naming a
page and asks what else they name — correct for a broadcast archive, wrong for
messages, where a five-to-fifteen-word row that names one person almost never
names a second. It returned **0 candidates across 7 pages** on the message dump.
`scan --conversation` scopes by counterparty instead, joining a page's infobox
`handles:` to the corpus's handle field: 30 people pages resolve, 41,349 rows,
51 candidates. `bin/wiki-crosslink handles` is the coverage view — and **138
people pages carry no `handles:` at all**, which is the message corpus's version
of the alias gap.

**A page name that is also ordinary English produces confident garbage.** `say
anything` returns 134 rows in the message dump and **none is the band**; `the
office` returns 77 and **none is the show**. Both are reported `high` because
the rule is "more than one token". They are now flagged with the count marked
not-evidence — flagged rather than demoted, because some really are the band.
This is the one class of the judgment failure that is mechanically catchable;
the rest still is not.

**A string two pages both claim is evidence for neither.** `@alexisarmel` is in
one person's `aliases:` and in another's infobox `handles:`; 85 rows about the
first came back as 101 mentions of the second. `scan` now marks such candidates
`contested`, and a contested candidate is not a candidate until the row is read.

**A refusal binds the candidate column too, not just the page being scanned.**
The moratorium that taught this was lifted on 2026-09-06 and `wiki-crosslink`
refuses nothing now, but the shape survives it: a scan output is a worklist
whichever column a page lands in, so any future holdout has to cover both ends.
The lesson cost a real leak — her page was refused as a subject and served as a
target with 101 mentions.
