# A lexical proxy good enough to start a conversation is not good enough to gate one

## Instruction

1. **Before a regex over a corpus is allowed to produce a verdict, read its
   matches.** Not a sample chosen to reassure you — `--examples N` output, in
   full, asking one question of each: *is this row the construct, or a string
   that resembles it?*
2. **Record the review where the tool can read it**, keyed to the proxy, with
   the string that breaks it named. A review held in a session transcript is a
   review the next run does not have.
3. **Cap the unreviewed.** An unreviewed proxy may report that the corpus is
   *silent* and nothing else. It may not confirm a score and — this is the
   load-bearing half — it may not contradict one.
4. **Exclude the broken outright rather than deleting them.** A proxy read and
   found broken is a finding; deleting it makes it look unwritten and invites
   the next session to write it again.
5. **A trait whose every proxy is broken bands as `no instrument`, never
   `silent`.** Silence implies an instrument ran and found nothing. They are
   different claims and collapsing them asserts a measurement that never
   happened.
6. **Hold reach and support patterns to the same standard.** A pattern used
   only for context still moves a row into a louder band and manufactures an
   obligation.

## Why

`bin/psychometrics` built its 23-proxy table for an exploratory sheet a human
reads top to bottom, and its docstring says outright that the matches must be
read before the counts are believed. `bin/wiki-traits` reused that table under
a much heavier load — a filter constraining what every future synthesis may
claim about registers 1, 2 and 11 of the constitution pass.

Its first run reported **`CONTRADICTED LOAD` on the Fe deficit**: an
instruction to re-read 37 pages, 17 of them synthesis. The verdict rested on
one proxy for *other-directed concern*, and every match was Dan being
comforted — *"Thank you for making me feel better sweetie"*, *"those are the
things you always make ME feel better about"*. The pattern caught `feel
better` and could not tell who was doing the feeling.

Six of 23 proxies broke the same way once read:

| Proxy | What it actually caught |
|---|---|
| `altruism / other-directed concern` | Dan receiving comfort — the inverse of the construct |
| `altruism / offering help unprompted` | Transactional offers: "I'll have suz car if you need a clean getaway" |
| `sympathy / sympathy tokens` | First-person apology, not sympathy extended — right by accident |
| `assertiveness / directives` | The anti-directive: "I want you to do things however you feel most comfortable" |
| `vulnerability / overwhelm` | Idiom: "too much of a babe", "I'm done smoking cigs" |
| `impulsiveness / immediacy` | Anticipation: "can't wait to see you" |

Three reach patterns broke the same way. `left`, intended for political
register, matched **"Checked, left standing"** — constitution-pass boilerplate
present on every synthesis page — and inflated one trait's reach from 34 pages
to 202, moving it into a cell that manufactured an obligation.

**The asymmetry is what makes the cap necessary.** Inherited from
`psychometrics`: failure to corroborate is not falsification, so only an
inversion is evidence against a score. That makes `INVERTED` the heaviest
verdict in the system — and it is simultaneously the cheapest to manufacture,
because a pattern that catches the wrong side of a conversation inverts
trivially. The heaviest verdict must therefore be the hardest to reach, which
is the opposite of what an unreviewed regex delivers.

## Validation

```bash
python3 -m unittest tests.test_wiki_traits -v   # VerdictCap, ReviewRegister, Traits
bin/wiki-traits review                          # the queue: 16 unreviewed, 6 broken, 1 sound
bin/psychometrics run --facet <facet> --examples 8   # how a review is actually done
```

`test_unreviewed_cannot_contradict` is the regression. If it is ever relaxed,
the first run's false headline becomes publishable again.
