# Skill Protocol

## 1. Capture the observation

A candidate skill starts as a concrete observation, not an instruction.

Good:
- "Pages returned 200 while serving the wrong artifact; HTTP success was not a valid deployment check."
- "A portal save deleted typed-edge claims without surfacing the loss in the ordinary workflow."

Bad:
- "Always be careful."
- "Use best practices."

Put the observation in `INBOX.md` with enough context to reproduce the reasoning.

## 2. Extract the invariant

Turn the observation into the smallest rule that prevents recurrence.

```text
failure → mechanism → invariant → instruction → validation
```

The instruction must name:
- **trigger** — when it applies
- **action** — what to do
- **reason** — what failure it prevents
- **validation** — how to know it worked

## 3. Validate before promotion

Promote a candidate to `active` only when at least one is true:

- it has prevented or explained the same class of failure more than once;
- a direct test, check, or reproducible command validates it;
- it is mechanically implied by existing repository behavior or a governing spec.

Otherwise keep it provisional or in the inbox.

## 4. Skill file format

`bin/wiki-skills new <domain>/<slug>` scaffolds this, and `bin/wiki-skills check`
enforces it: every key below is required, `status` must be one of the four in
`INDEX.md`, `validated` must be a real past date, the three sections marked
required must be present, and no scaffold placeholder may survive. The gate runs
inside `bin/wiki-check`, so a malformed skill blocks a commit.

```markdown
---
status: active
scope: repo
triggers:
  - description of applicable work
sources:
  - file/path/or/incident
validated: YYYY-MM-DD
supersedes: []
---

# Skill name

## Instruction

Imperative, specific steps.

## Why

The failure mode or invariant.

## Validation

Exact command, test, inspection, or observable condition.

## Known limits

Where the rule does not apply.
```

## 5. Model and agent portability

Skills must describe outcomes and repository actions, not depend on one vendor's hidden behavior.

Model-specific material is allowed only when it genuinely matters. Put it under a clearly labeled `## Adapter notes` section, for example:

- Claude: use `CLAUDE.md` as the governing entrypoint.
- Codex: map the same skill to its repository instruction mechanism.
- Cursor/other agent: read the canonical file directly when no native rule loader exists.

The canonical skill remains in this repository. Adapters are copies or pointers, never competing sources of truth.

## 6. Revision and retirement

Never overwrite history by silently changing what a skill means.

- revise when the invariant survives but the instruction improves;
- deprecate when a better skill replaces it;
- retire when evidence shows it is wrong or obsolete.

Record every state transition in `CHANGELOG.md` with the date and reason. This
is checked, not merely asked: a skill file never named in `CHANGELOG.md` fails
`bin/wiki-skills check`, because an instruction with no dated account of why it
should be believed cannot be weighed by anyone who arrives later.

A replacement declares `supersedes: [<slug>]`, and the superseded file must then
be `deprecated` or `retired`. Leaving it `active` is also a gate failure — that
is the case where the router hands an agent two live instructions for one
situation and it follows whichever it reads first. Retired skills stay in the
tree and appear in the index's History table; deleting one leaves the agent who
remembers being told it with nothing to correct it.

## 7. End-of-task reflection

Before closing substantial work, run this mental diff:

> What did this agent have to discover that the next agent should not have to rediscover?

If the answer is concrete and reusable, capture it. This is the LEARN operation
in `CLAUDE.md`, which carries the full protocol; `bin/wiki-skills next` lists
what is already waiting.

Capturing is not promoting. A candidate parked with its evidence still missing is
doing its job, and promoting it early is the worse error: the index vouches for
what it lists, and the next agent has no way to tell a validated instruction from
a confident guess. "Left in the inbox, still needs X" is a complete outcome.
