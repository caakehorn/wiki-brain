# The registry — the running database

`skills/*.md` is prose: the contract, the protocol, and the written skills. A
person reads it. This directory is the other half — a machine-written database
of **what each model actually has**, so a session can find out what it is
working with instead of rediscovering it.

```text
skills/registry/
├── README.md              this file — the format
├── events.jsonl           the record. Append-only. Never rewritten.
├── registry.json          a projection of the log. Regenerable, safe to delete.
└── manifests/             worked examples — the half a scan cannot see
```

The public face is [`wiki/meta/skills.md`](../../wiki/meta/skills.md), generated
by `bin/wiki-skills page` and served on the portal like any other page.

## Why a log and not a file somebody edits

Several models may push in the same hour, from different branches. Two appends
to a JSONL file merge as a set union by event id and git resolves it without
help. One mutable JSON document makes every concurrent push a conflict, and the
loser is dropped silently — which is the exact failure a shared database exists
to prevent. Same arrangement as `intake/`, for a sharper reason.

`registry.json` is derived. If it disagrees with the log, the log is right:
`bin/wiki-skills rebuild`.

## Pushing

```bash
bin/wiki-skills push --scan --agent <id> --vendor <vendor> --surface <surface>
bin/wiki-skills push -f skills/registry/manifests/<you>.json
bin/wiki-skills page && bin/wiki-check
```

`--scan` reads what **this repository** supplies and no model has to be told:
the skills under `.claude/skills/` and `skills/`, every command in `bin/` with
its own docstring as the summary, MCP servers configured in the tree, hooks, and
subagent definitions. The manifest carries the other half — the skills, MCP
servers, plugin tools, subagents and harness a model has that nothing in the
working tree records. That asymmetry is why there are two inputs.

A push is **idempotent**: re-declaring a capability whose content digest already
matches appends nothing. Run it every session.

## The manifest format

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "id": "codex",
    "name": "Codex",
    "vendor": "OpenAI",
    "surface": "cli",
    "model": "…",
    "note": "one line about how this agent is used here"
  },
  "capabilities": [
    {
      "kind": "mcp_server",
      "name": "github",
      "title": "GitHub MCP server",
      "summary": "one line — what it is and when to reach for it",
      "provider": "GitHub",
      "scope": "agent",
      "transport": "http",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": ["GITHUB_TOKEN"],
      "tools": ["create_pull_request", "search_code"],
      "link": "https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server",
      "path": "",
      "triggers": ["anything touching a pull request"],
      "version": "",
      "instructions": "The full text, where the capability IS an instruction."
    }
  ]
}
```

`kind` is one of `skill`, `mcp_server`, `plugin`, `tool`, `command`, `hook`,
`subagent`, `harness`. `scope` is `repo` (it lives in this tree), `agent` (this
model brings it) or `global`.

Required: `kind`, `name`, `summary`, and **at least one of** `path`, `link` or
`instructions` — a capability nothing can be reached through is a rumour, and
the gate rejects it. Everything else is optional. The loader is forgiving:
`description` works for `summary`, `url` for `link`, a bare string for
`triggers`. Keys beginning with `_` are ignored, so a manifest can carry
comments.

Identity is `(kind, name)` across every model. Two agents declaring `github`
produce one capability with two declarers — which is the point: a capability
more than one model has is a capability a lesson can be written against.

## The one rule with teeth

**This repository is public and its history cannot be un-published.**

MCP server configurations are the most reliable place in an agent's environment
to find a live API key. "Push everything about your tools into the wiki" is,
written naively, an instruction to publish credentials.

So values never enter the database — only names. Environment variables are
recorded as a sorted list of **names**; URLs are stripped of userinfo and query
string. Anything still matching a credential shape is a **refusal naming the
field**, never a silent strip: `--env FOO=bar` is rejected rather than quietly
halved, because stripping teaches the next caller that pushing values is fine.

`bin/wiki-skills check` re-scans the committed database on every gate run, so a
hand-edit cannot get one past the writer.

The one deliberate exception is `scan` reading a real `.mcp.json` off disk: its
values are dropped rather than refused, because refusing would make the command
unusable on any machine with a working key. Nothing from that file's values is
stored.

## Reading it

```bash
bin/wiki-skills                     # what the database holds
bin/wiki-skills list --kind command # every repository command, with summaries
bin/wiki-skills show wiki-plain     # one capability in full, with its history
bin/wiki-skills diff claude-code codex   # what one model has that the other lacks
```

`diff` is the iterate-off-each-other view. It reports three things: what only A
has, what only B has, and — the interesting one — capabilities **both** declare
whose content digests differ, meaning one of them has revised the instruction
and the other has not caught up.

## What does not belong here

Prompts, personalities and session state. A capability is something a model can
invoke. Where the work stands is `LLM_HANDOFF.md`; what is outstanding is
`WORK.md`; what agents have **learned** about working here is `skills/` itself,
which this database indexes and does not replace.
