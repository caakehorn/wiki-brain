# Agent Skills

This directory is the persistent memory for **how to work on wiki-brain**.

The rest of the repository records what the system knows. `skills/` records what agents and LLMs have learned about **changing the system without repeatedly rediscovering the same operational knowledge**.

A skill is not a personality prompt and not a generic coding guideline. It is a reusable, evidence-backed instruction produced by work on this repository.

## Core rule

> When an agent learns something that would make the next agent materially better at touching this codebase, it writes that learning back here.

This is a feedback loop:

```text
work → observation → candidate instruction → validation → skill → reuse → revision
```

No model is the permanent owner. Claude, Codex, ChatGPT, Cursor, local agents, scripts, and future tools all read and improve the same corpus.

## Two layers, one subsystem

The prose layer answers *what should an agent do here?* and a person reads it.
It cannot answer the other question, which is the one that actually blocks
cross-model work: **what does each model actually have?** A Claude Code session
arrives with skills, MCP servers, plugin tools and subagents a Codex session
does not have, and neither can see the other's. So there is a second layer, and
it is a database rather than prose because its writers are machines running in
parallel.

`INDEX.md` is **generated from the skill files** and must not be hand-edited. It
once carried a `Status` column duplicating each skill's own `status:`
frontmatter — two sources of truth for one fact, and the drift showed up within
a day. Change a skill's status or triggers in its own file, then
`bin/wiki-lessons scan`.

`bin/wiki-skills` is a different tool over a different thing: it writes the
**registry**, the cross-model database of what each model *has*, and
`wiki/meta/skills.md` is its public face. `bin/wiki-lessons` routes and gates the
prose you are reading; `bin/wiki-skills` records capabilities. Full instruction
for the second: `skills/agents/registry-push.md`.

## Mandatory session behavior

Mandatory here because `CLAUDE.md` says so — see its session-start section and
the LEARN operation. That routing is what makes this directory load-bearing; for
the first hours of its existence it did not exist, and a contract nobody is
routed to is a contract with no counterparty.

Before making a non-trivial code or repository change:

1. Run `bin/wiki-lessons route "<what you are about to do>"`. It performs step 2
   of the routing algorithm against every skill's triggers.
2. Load what it names, narrowest first.
3. Follow the instructions unless a higher-priority governing file overrides them.
4. Push what you have into the registry, and read what the others have:

   ```bash
   bin/wiki-skills push --scan --agent <your-id> --vendor <v> --surface <s>
   bin/wiki-skills push -f skills/registry/manifests/<your-id>.json
   bin/wiki-skills page
   ```

   The scan covers this repository. The manifest covers your own skills, MCP
   servers, plugin tools, subagents and harness — nothing in the working tree
   records those, so if you do not declare them nobody else will know you had
   them. The push is idempotent; recording nothing is a success. **Environment
   variable names only, never a value: this repository is public.**

After completing work:

1. Ask whether the session exposed a repeatable failure mode, hidden invariant, useful command sequence, or model-specific trap.
2. If yes, add it to `skills/INBOX.md` or revise an existing skill.
3. Promote only validated instructions according to `skills/PROTOCOL.md`.
4. Record promotions, revisions, and retirements in `skills/CHANGELOG.md`.
5. `bin/wiki-skills check` before committing. It runs inside `bin/wiki-check`.

## This is not `.claude/skills/`

Two directories in this repository are called skills, and they hold different
things.

| | `skills/` (here) | `.claude/skills/` |
|---|---|---|
| Holds | durable lessons about changing the repo | procedures for running one wiki operation |
| Loaded | by trigger, via `bin/wiki-skills route` | by name, by Claude Code |
| Audience | any agent or model | Claude Code specifically |
| Named in | `CLAUDE.md`'s session loop and LEARN | `CLAUDE.md` where that operation is defined |
| Examples | `repo/stale-premise.md` | `wiki-rewrite`, `wiki-housekeeping` |

A lesson about the machinery goes here. A procedure for a whole operation —
REWRITE, LINT — goes there. When a lesson here grows into a full procedure,
promote it across and leave a pointer behind.

## What belongs here

- repo-specific commands that are easy to get subtly wrong
- invariants discovered while debugging
- workflow sequences that prevent recurring failures
- tool/agent differences that matter in this repository
- reliable validation procedures
- lessons extracted from failed PRs, merge conflicts, broken builds, or silent regressions

## What does not belong here

- generic programming advice
- temporary session state (use `LLM_HANDOFF.md`)
- standing work (use `BACKLOG.md` / `bin/wiki-work`)
- source facts about Dan or the wiki corpus
- one-off prompts with no reusable operational content

## Governing relationship

`CLAUDE.md` governs repository operations. Existing specs govern their named domains. Skills are subordinate to those documents: they operationalize knowledge; they do not silently override policy.

When a skill conflicts with a governing document, the governing document wins and the conflict itself should be recorded for repair.
