# LLM Model Coordination & Handoff Log

**Purpose:** This file acts as a centralized brain and handoff document for different AI models working on the Wiki Rewrite Project. Because this project is being handled across multiple sessions and potentially different models, this file ensures continuity, tracks recent file changes, and dictates the immediate next steps.

---

## 🛑 INSTRUCTIONS FOR INCOMING MODELS
1. **Read this file first** to understand the current state of the project.
2. **Check `task.md`** in the root directory for the granular task checklist.
3. **Check `STYLE_GUIDE.md`** (or `CLAUDE.md`) for the strict formatting and prose rules.
4. **When you finish your session**, update the **Session Log** below with a brief, clear summary of what files you modified and what your last action was. Update the **Current Focus** section so the next model knows exactly where to pick up.

## 🎯 Current Project Status
- **Phase 1 (Core Spine):** Complete (`context-core.md`, `overview.md`, `index.md`).
- **Phase 2 (Concepts):** Complete. All concepts rewritten to prose and stabilized.
- **Contact Stubs Issue:** Resolved. 97 stubs cross-referenced against `contacts.csv`; 73 renamed; collisions merged. 2 more (danielle-onesi, alexi-armel) merged into primary pages 2026-07-11. ~22 unidentified `contact-xxxxxx` stubs remain (await user identification).
- **STYLE_GUIDE.md now EXISTS** (repo root) — it is the binding page-format spec. The extended frontmatter that earlier sessions introduced (title/aliases/tags/importance/changelog + LLM Quick Brief) is now official; invented page_types like `author-stub` are banned (use `status: stub`). `bin/wiki-lint` must pass (0 errors) before every commit.
- **Phase 3 (Synthesis):** 5 of 12 done (forensic-methodology, attachment-trauma-bond, totality-themes, ai-collaborative-analysis, political-psyops).

## 🚀 Current Focus & Next Steps
**NEW USER DIRECTIVE (2026-07-13, overrides phase order):** The user judged the wiki's articles "absolutely terrible" in priorities and depth. Three standing orders:
1. **Importance-first structure** — big life events get real articles (e.g. the 2015 arrest now has `wiki/legal/2015-retail-theft-arrest.md`); trivia gets folded in (the BFS drawer dispute is now one page at `wiki/work/bfs-foods.md`, not four).
2. **DENSE pages, mined from raw/** — pages must carry actual content (all personality results with detailed breakdowns now live in `wiki/mind/profile/` — 7 pages incl. a dedicated INTP page). Do not restyle old wiki text; go back to raw sources.
3. **The breadth pass: "thousands of individually trivial missing things."** Named example (done): SLOPPP's page now has its full reconstructed discography + history, mined from Facebook-export share links, Twitter analysis, and message dumps. EVERY comparable page should get this treatment: alias pages, people pages, favorites pages, event pages. Mine raw/ link slugs, the LIFE_EVENTS_CALENDAR, the FB export HTML, and the message CSVs for concrete facts (dates, titles, counts, quotes). GitHub (PR #2, branch claude/wiki-article-restructure-agac7x) is the authoritative copy — push after every chunk.

Then: remaining Phase 3/4 work per task.md, and the chats/ pages cleanup (they still contain /tmp paths and HTML-comment agent chatter).

**NEW USER DIRECTIVE (2026-07-11):** The user judges current page content "an okay start" but wants a deeper pass: pages "omit or look over the most important information" and the categorization needs redesign. Phase 9 added to task.md — a content-depth audit that goes back to raw/ sources per page instead of only polishing prose. When rewriting any page from here on, do not just restyle the existing text: re-read the page's raw/ sources and ask what the *most important* facts are, then lead with those.

**Contact stubs:** `contact-review.md` (repo root) lists all 23 unnamed stubs with handles/samples for the user to name or DELETE (5 pre-marked as automated/spam). Process the user's decisions when they say so.

**Subscription-independent ingestion now exists:** `INGEST_PROTOCOL.md` + `bin/ingest-pack` / `bin/ingest-apply` let ANY chat LLM run an ingestion via copy-paste. If you are not Claude Code, this is also how you can apply multi-file changes safely.

Standing rules learned this cycle:
- Commit your work before ending a session — do not leave the tree dirty.
- Never write exports/corpus files into the repo root (exports/ is gitignored).
- Process inbox capture notes (especially `targets:` corrections and `[BRACKET]` operator instructions) BEFORE rewriting the pages they touch — see STYLE_GUIDE.md "Capture-note handling."
- Renames must update every inbound link (`grep -r` before and after) and merge any matching `contacts/` stub.

---

## ⭐ THE SUBSTANCE STANDARD (read before rewriting anything)
STYLE_GUIDE.md now has a **Substance rules** section that outranks all
formatting rules. Core test: the first paragraph must answer the stranger's
question (person → who is this to Dan + current state + defining thing;
event → what happened + what changed). Order by consequence, not
chronology. Say load-bearing conclusions plainly. Name gaps explicitly.
**Match the exemplars:** `wiki/people/annie.md`, `wiki/people/suz.md`,
`wiki/timeline/events/eli-incident.md` — these were written at the target
quality bar; imitate their shape exactly. A page that is tidy but leads
with corpus statistics instead of the story is a FAILED page.

## 📝 Session Log (Newest First)

### [2026-07-13] - Session: Great Restructure (mind/self/legal) + enrichment start
* **Model:** Claude Fable 5 (Claude Code, remote)
* **Summary:**
  - Re-architected mind/self/legal per user directive. NEW `wiki/mind/profile/` cluster (7 dense pages: hub/intp/enneagram-5w4/big-five-psychometrics/socionics-and-attitudinal/deviance-mapping/linguistic-profile) mined from FULL PROFILE 2026 + Dan Profile.txt.
  - Merges: 5 forensic pages → `mind/concepts/forensic-method`; 4 prompt-artifact pages → `mind/concepts/exocortex`; aesthetic-politics → political-psyops; work-power-dynamics → vertical-authority-skepticism (rewritten); family-heritage-and-roots → self/ancestry; financial-market-era → `timeline/periods/2020-2021-market-era`; millennial-digital-witness rewritten.
  - Legal: NEW `legal/2015-retail-theft-arrest` (Combos incident, ARD Feb 17 2016, Judge Wagner); 463-morgantown 3 pages → 1; BFS moved to `work/bfs-foods` (merged 4 pages); NEW `work/au-zaatar`. self/notes/ dissolved; jimmy-pop → `interests/rock-irrelevance-thesis`.
  - Enrichment: SLOPPP full discography (23 dated releases from FB export slugs; "Goodbye Demo" Dec 26 2015 = project end); MOGZART catalog + confirmed 2026 revival (Odd Mob DnB remix Mar 4 2026, status→active); self/overview rewritten biography-first.
  - bin/wiki-lint: added missing `profile` page_type. Lint 0 errors. All work on PR #2 (draft), branch `claude/wiki-article-restructure-agac7x`.
* **Handoff Note:** Continue the breadth pass (see Current Focus). GRIPNOTIC/mogged-up pages not yet enriched. self/index still auto-generated-style; chats/ pages still dirty.

### [2026-07-11] - Session: Annie Data Audit (source-completeness check)
* **Model:** Claude Fable 5 (Claude Code)
* **Summary:**
  - User flagged semi-correct info in annie.md. Root cause found: the page was synthesized from `DanAnnie_MasterRecord_March16.docx` while SIX newer dossiers in `raw/self/dox-scan/` (MasterRecord_FINAL, TenYears_WithAmendments, TheoryOfEverything_Updated, CompleteRecord_Final, CompleteAnalysis_Final, MoralAnalysis_SFW) were never read. "2"-prefixed variants are byte-identical dupes.
  - Fixed on annie.md: 94 burst events were misattributed to Annie (they are Dan's "crash-outs," each preceded by her silence); phantom source `raw/self/imessage/annie_full_archive.csv` replaced with the real dual-handle CSV (88,549 rows); record scope corrected (all-platform 126,683 msgs, Nov 28 2015 – Mar 16 2026); three ACCEPTED financial amendments folded in (oscillatory funding history); 187:4 ratio + 12 crisis statements + 36.5h silences + social colonization added; June 5 2026 post-closure apology recorded.
  - New page: `wiki/timeline/events/march-2026-terminal-phase.md` (laundry response, bathroom incident, confession + retraction).
  - queue.md: HIGH item — full synthesis of the 6 dossiers into attachment-trauma-bond / conflict-architecture / eli-incident; MEDIUM — locate 4 compiled source files absent from disk (Dan_Annie_Full_Text.txt etc.).
* **Handoff Note:** Lesson for all rewrites: check dox-scan for FINAL/amended versions before trusting any dated dossier. annie.md is 12KB (over budget, tolerated as critical hub — trim on next pass if it grows).

### [2026-07-11] - Session: Substance Standard + Exemplars (Fable quota burn)
* **Model:** Claude Fable 5 (Claude Code)
* **Summary:**
  - Added **Substance rules** to STYLE_GUIDE.md (first-paragraph test, consequence ordering, plain conclusions, gaps-as-content). These propagate automatically into every `bin/ingest-pack` prompt.
  - Rewrote three exemplars to the target bar: `annie.md` (metrics wall demoted, gaslighting-outweighed-affair thesis leads, LLM Quick Brief added), `suz.md` (verbatim Gemini transplants removed; her co-authorship of the 2004-05 rupture — previously buried in a timeline row — now leads; Suzy-call node, housing contingencies, dual-role structure), `eli-incident.md` (lead paragraph + status fix).
  - /fewer-permission-prompts: added ./bin/wiki-lint variant + ingest-pack/export-corpus to project allowlist.
* **Handoff Note:** Rewrites from here must meet the substance bar, not just the prose bar. Remaining: 7 Phase 3 synthesis pages, Phase 4 people (fran-whyel, rick-frank, tom, eli, anita...), contact-review.md decisions pending user.

### [2026-07-11] - Session: Coordination Stabilization + Phase 3 Continuation
* **Model:** Claude Fable 5 (Claude Code)
* **Summary:**
  - Audited the multi-model workflow; verdict: output good, coordination drifting. Fixes:
  - Committed prior session's uncommitted Phase 3 work (3 synthesis rewrites + task.md).
  - Untracked `corpus_2026-07-11.md` (1MB export accidentally committed to root); gitignored `corpus_*.md`.
  - **Wrote `STYLE_GUIDE.md`** — codifies extended frontmatter, LLM Quick Brief, capture bracket-instructions; CLAUDE.md now points to it. Fixed 8 invalid page_types (`author-stub`/`artist-stub` → `entity`+`stub`); lint back to 0 errors.
  - Added the two missing oversized pages to task.md Phase 3.
  - **Ingested both capture corrections:** `danielle.md`→`danielle-onesi.md` (full name, "Dee", merged 44-msg contact stub) and `lex.md`→`alexis-armel.md` (aliases, merged 41-msg inbound-only stub, first-mention Alexis links added in 12 pages). All inbound links rewritten; notes filed to `raw/people/captures/`.
  - **Phase 3:** rewrote `ai-collaborative-analysis.md` (21KB→7.6KB, worst v1 chatter in wiki) and `political-psyops.md` (11KB→6.9KB, triplicated J6 sections deduped).
  - App renderer now supports `[[path|label]]` pipe links.
* **Handoff Note:** Tree clean, lint 0 errors / 16 warnings (all size-budget). Next: remaining 7 Phase 3 synthesis files, then Phase 4. Inbox holds 3 items (saratoga-drive story, ANCESTRY_DNA.txt, takeout manifest) awaiting regular ingestion.

### [2026-07-11] - Session: Contact Stubs & Phase 2 Completion
* **Model:** Gemini 3.1 Pro (High) / Antigravity
* **Summary:** 
  - Wrote a python script (`bin/contact-rename.py`) to cross-reference 97 `contact-xxxxxx.md` stubs against `contacts.csv`. Successfully renamed 73 stubs to proper names. 
  - Identified two collisions from the rename: `vanessa-frank.md` and `annie-ulmer.md`. Merged their high-volume iMessage corpus data into the canonical `wiki/people/vanessa-frank.md` and `wiki/people/annie.md` pages, then deleted the redundant contact stubs.
  - Completed the remaining Phase 2 concept rewrites: `conflict-architecture.md`, `dans-law.md`, `forensic-analysis.md`, `cato.md`, and `phenomenology-lens.md`. Converted fragments to prose, formatted tables, and set status to `stable`.
  - Checked off Phase 2 in `task.md`.
  - Committed all changes to git.
* **Handoff Note:** The repository is in a clean state. Ready to tackle Phase 3 or Phase 4.

### [2026-07-11] - Session: Phase 1 & 2 Kickoff (Previous Session)
* **Summary:** 
  - Upgraded frontmatter and added LLM briefs to `wiki/self/index.md` and `wiki/self/overview.md`.
  - Fixed status in `wiki/self/context-core.md`.
  - Full style-guide rewrite for `wiki/people/annie.md`.
  - Prose rewrites for `wiki/mind/concepts/abyssal-architect.md`, `attachment-model.md`, and `contact-gini.md`.
  - Fixed `.git/index.lock` issue and committed changes.
