# Phantom Source Audit

Generated: 2026-08-20 00:29:32

## Summary

- **Phantom sources found:** 10 — **superseded, see banner**

> **SUPERSEDED [2026-08-20 review pass]. The real figure is 4 files, 2 cited.**
> Six of the ten listed below are `.gitkeep` placeholders: empty **by design**,
> never cited as evidence, and now excluded (`STRUCTURAL_FILES` in
> `bin/wiki-lint`). The four genuine ones are:
> `raw/self/message-csv/END_FIGHT_full.csv` (68 B, header only),
> `annie_group_chat_may31-june1_2026.csv` (68 B),
> `annie_group_chat_relaxed.csv` (57 B),
> `messenger_export_THREADKEY_HERE.csv` (0 B).
>
> The companion claim that 5 pages "cite" them was produced by matching bare
> filenames against whole page bodies. `raw/` holds **3,313 files under 1,430
> distinct basenames — 1,041 of those basenames collide**, so a basename cannot
> identify a source. Checking `sources:` frontmatter citations instead (the
> documented convention, which uses repo-relative paths) gives **2** real
> citations, both of `END_FIGHT_full.csv`:
> `wiki/mind/synthesis/dan-annie-fallout-verdict.md` and
> `wiki/timeline/events/group-chat-closure.md`. Prose mentions — e.g.
> `source-coverage-index`, which catalogues these files on purpose — are
> correctly no longer flagged.
>
> **This report is now reproducible:** `bin/wiki-lint` emits it as warnings.
> **Never substitute a different file for an empty one.** Re-export or de-cite.
