3. **9 `sources:` → `synthesizes:` errors**: New pages (personality assessments, ally-and-dan-love-as-destiny, astrology-star-signs) have wiki paths in `sources:` instead of `synthesizes:`.
4. **10 pages contain retracted "$750/week" figure**.
5. **7 pages cite phantom sources** (empty/header-only raw files).
6. **36 islanded pages** (18 are music artist favorites, 5 are LLM entries).
7. **30 pages with `status: archived` outside `archive/`**.
8. **215 pages not modified since before 2026-08-01**.

## 2. TOP 20 HIGHEST-VALUE OPPORTUNITIES

### Priority Formula

Priority ≈ (potential information gained) × (downstream impact) × (likelihood of being real) ÷ (estimated effort)

### The Top 20

| # | TITLE | TYPE | PRIORITY | WHY |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Gchat archive extraction (gmail_bodies.txt) | SOURCE_MINING | **HIGHEST** | 902KB, 2010-2013 daily life, only daily record of that period, 495+ conversation blocks. One correspondent's slice reorganized alexis-armel. The rest is unread. |
| 2 | Fix 9 `sources:` → `synthesizes:` errors | MECHANICAL | **HIGH** | Deterministic, low risk, immediately fixes wiki-climb check errors. Affects 4 pages. |
| 3 | Regenerate LLM manifest + DIGEST | MECHANICAL | **HIGH** | Deterministic, low risk. Brings machine-readable projection in sync with wiki. |
| 4 | Retracted "$750/week" correction cascade | QUALITY | **HIGH** | 10 pages carry retracted figure. 2 have correction blocks that never actually changed the text. Requires grep + manual correction. |
| 5 | Per-contact iMessage CSV sweep | SOURCE_MINING | **HIGH** | 16 CSVs, some covering 2022-2026 (absent from main dump). Rick Frank pass reversed a standing figure. Systematic sweep of uncited contacts. |
| 6 | ChatGPT export extraction (9.5MB JSON) | SOURCE_MINING | **HIGH** | dfrank-chatgpt-conversations-2022-2025.json. Contains Dan's own words and self-assessments. Not yet mined. |
| 7 | 36 islanded pages — wire into graph | CONNECTION | **HIGH** | 18 music artist pages reachable only from indexes. Need inbound prose edges or explicit demotion. |
| 8 | 30 pages `status: archived` outside archive/ | QUALITY | **HIGH** | Semantically wrong status makes pages look exempt from correction. 2018-deep-cycle was feeding false claim to timeline. |
| 9 | Contradiction resolution (33 live) | SYNTHESIS | **MEDIUM-HIGH** | OPEN.md lists 33 live contradictions. Resolving them improves model accuracy. |
| 10 | 2025-collapse cluster synthesis | SYNTHESIS | **MEDIUM-HIGH** | Appears in 5 synthesis queue clusters (scores 12.30-13.30). Cross-domain: people, self, timeline, work. |
| 11 | Relationship architecture synthesis | SYNTHESIS | **MEDIUM-HIGH** | Multiple synthesis clusters involve annie-ulmer, alexis-armel, bond-switch-2015, gemini-activity. Pattern worth investigating. |
| 12 | 215 stale pages review | QUALITY | **MEDIUM** | Pages with date_modified before Aug 1. Some may carry outdated claims. |
| 13 | Graph retrofit: 996 bare `related:` entries | CONNECTION | **MEDIUM** | Largest untouched hygiene block. Requires semantic judgment per pair. |
| 14 | Location History mining (50 files, 2014-2023) | SOURCE_MINING | **MEDIUM** | Semantic Location History JSON files. Can verify/falsify timeline claims. |
| 15 | Facebook Messenger HTML extraction | SOURCE_MINING | **MEDIUM** | Contains message-level data. Some already mined for behavioral findings. |
| 16 | Entity disambiguation (788 candidates) | ENTITY | **MEDIUM** | 788 entities with 3+ mentions and no page. Top candidates: New York (195), Dan Frank (161), Gazette Pavilion (161), Fayette County (148), Full Sail (128). |
| 17 | Interest evolution synthesis | SYNTHESIS | **MEDIUM** | Clusters 11, 13, 22 involve interests-as-era-markers, stand-up-comedy, video-games, teen-concert-years. |
| 18 | People significance audit | QUALITY | **MEDIUM** | 165 people pages. Dozens appear to be peripheral (1 mention, no temporal span). |
| 19 | OPEN.md gap closure (332 open gaps) | SOURCE_MINING | **MEDIUM-MEDIUM** | Many gaps name specific sources that could settle them. |
| 20 | Master timeline regeneration | MECHANICAL | **MEDIUM** | 599KB, generated by wiki-timeline. Should be in pre-commit block per BACKLOG. |

## 3. HIGH-VALUE SOURCE-MINING CAMPAIGNS

### 3.1 Campaign A: Gchat Archive (HIGHEST ROI)

- **Source:** `raw/self/dox-scan/gmail_bodies.txt`
- **Size:** 902 KB
- **Format:** Plain text chat archive
- **Date coverage:** ~2010-2013
- **Unique value:** Only *daily-life* record of 2010-2013. Everything else from that period is retrospective.
- **Evidence:** One correspondent's slice (495 conversation blocks under `lexieamb@gmail.com`) was read in August 2026 and reorganized `alexis-armel`. The rest is unread.
- **Work plan:**
  1. Read entire file to exhaustion
  2. Identify all named people
  3. Identify all dates or date bounds
  4. Identify all events, work, relationships, interests
  5. Contradict existing wiki claims where found
- **Recommended agent:** Claude (requires exhaustion reading, not mechanical)

### 3.2 Campaign B: Per-Contact iMessage CSV Sweep

- **Source:** `raw/self/message-csv/*_both_all_now.csv` (16 files)
- **Size range:** 2.8 KB → 19 MB
- **Format:** CSV
- **Date coverage:** Varies; some cover 2022-2026 (absent from main dump)
- **Unique value:** Most complete two-sided relationship records. Per-contact exports often contain messages absent from general dumps.
- **Evidence:** Rick Frank pass found a CSV that had never been cited anywhere and reversed a standing figure.
- **Work plan:**
  1. For each CSV, resolve phone number against a person page
  2. Check against that page's `sources:` list
  3. For uncited contacts, read the full CSV
  4. Reconstruct chronology and relationship patterns
  5. Cross-check against existing wiki claims
- **Recommended agent:** Claude (requires reading and cross-checking)

### 3.3 Campaign C: ChatGPT Export Extraction

- **Source:** `raw/self/chatgpt-export/dfrank-chatgpt-conversations-2022-2025.json`
- **Size:** 9.5 MB
- **Format:** JSON
- **Date coverage:** 2022-2025
- **Unique value:** Contains Dan's own words, self-assessments, and corrections. Often the only place certain thoughts are recorded.
- **Evidence:** Not yet mined. AI-secondary source (Dan's words are primary testimony; model's assertions are not).
- **Work plan:**
  1. Parse JSON structure
  2. Identify conversations containing Dan's own words
  3. Extract self-assessments, corrections, and testimony
  4. Attribute AI-generated material as such
  5. Write findings into relevant pages
- **Recommended agent:** Claude (requires understanding context and attribution)

### 3.4 Campaign D: Dox-Scan RTF/TXT Files

- **Sources:**
  - `raw/self/dox-scan/Shelbie Breakiron on 2019-04-17 at 16.08.35.rtf` (17.3 MB)
  - `raw/self/dox-scan/Untitled copy.rtf` (2.5 MB)
  - `raw/self/dox-scan/fullcombo 2.txt` (207 KB)
  - `raw/self/dox-scan/STYLE_MAP.rtf` (151 KB)
  - `raw/self/dox-scan/okay now i want you to consolidate everything you....rtf` (467 KB)
- **Format:** RTF/TXT
- **Date coverage:** Unknown (not yet read)
- **Unique value:** Unknown size of find. Could contain interview transcripts, dossiers, or other rich material.
- **Recommended agent:** Claude (requires reading)

### 3.5 Campaign E: Semantic Location History

- **Source:** `raw/self/location/2026-06-22-ingest/Location History (Timeline)/Semantic Location History/`
- **Files:** ~50 JSON files covering 2014-2023
- **Format:** JSON
- **Date coverage:** 2014-2023
- **Unique value:** Can verify/falsify timeline claims about where Dan was at specific times.
- **Evidence:** Residence timeline has gaps (spring-summer 2018 sleeping location unresolved).
- **Work plan:**
  1. Parse JSON for location clusters
  2. Map to timeline periods
  3. Resolve open gaps (e.g., spring-summer 2018)
- **Recommended agent:** Either (deterministic parsing + Claude for interpretation)

### 3.6 Campaign F: Facebook Messenger HTML

- **Source:** `raw/self/facebook/facebook-ihatedanfrank/`
- **Files:** Multiple HTML files
- **Size:** 82 MB zip + extracted HTML
- **Unique value:** Message-level data from Facebook. Some already mined for behavioral findings (contact-gini, message-circadian-latency).
- **Evidence:** BACKLOG.md notes behavioral mining over lexical has produced strongest findings.
- **Recommended agent:** Claude (requires parsing HTML and extracting behavioral patterns)

### 3.7 Campaign G: Notes & Unfiled Documents

- **Sources:**
  - `raw/self/notes/drawer-dispute.md` (174 KB)
  - `raw/self/notes/manipulation-ethics.md` (144 KB)
  - `raw/self/notes/jimmy-pop.md` (139 KB)
  - `raw/self/dox-md/Little Caesars retaliation timing concerns (1).md` (113 KB)
  - `raw/self/dox-md/_AI_Protocol_for_Persuasion.md` (125 KB)
- **Format:** Markdown
- **Unique value:** Unfiled captures. Could contain operator testimony, corrections, or new evidence.
- **Recommended agent:** Claude (requires reading and integration)

## 9. CLAUDE-ONLY RESEARCH QUEUE

For each item, a cheap agent should NOT do this because it requires interpretation, chronology reconstruction, entity disambiguation, causal analysis, or deciding whether evidence supports a claim.

### 9.1 Source Mining

| Item | Why Claude |
|---|---|
| Gchat archive extraction (gmail_bodies.txt) | Requires exhaustion reading, chasing proper nouns, noting contradictions |
| Per-contact iMessage CSV sweep | Requires reading full CSVs, reconstructing chronologies, cross-checking |
| ChatGPT export extraction | Requires understanding context, attributing AI vs human material |
| Dox-scan RTF/TXT files | Requires reading long documents, extracting findings |
| Semantic Location History | Requires parsing JSON, mapping to timeline, resolving gaps |
| Facebook Messenger HTML | Requires parsing HTML, extracting behavioral patterns |

### 9.2 Entity Work

| Item | Why Claude |
|---|---|
| Entity disambiguation (788 candidates) | Requires deciding if mentions refer to same entity, merging, or creating pages |
| Identity resolution | Requires cross-checking contact exports, name variants, handles |

### 9.3 Timeline Work

| Item | Why Claude |
|---|---|
| Spring-summer 2018 sleeping location | Requires reading message logs, reconciling conflicting addresses |
| Dec 1-31 Annie entries corrections | Requires reading, correcting, flagging |
| 2021-2022 near-silence explanation | Requires investigating absence of evidence |
| Suz thread collapse July 2026 | Requires reading messages before/after, identifying cause |

### 9.4 Synthesis Work

| Item | Why Claude |
|---|---|---|
| 2025-collapse cluster synthesis | Requires reading member pages, finding governing rule |
| Relationship architecture synthesis | Requires reading partner pages, identifying patterns |
| Interest evolution synthesis | Requires reading interest pages, identifying lifecycle |
| Information control as intimacy | Requires reading dated instances, evaluating generalization |
| NY partners as informational environment | Requires reading alexis-armel, annie-ulmer, gemini-activity |

### 9.5 Contradiction Resolution

| Item | Why Claude |
|---|---|---|
| 33 live contradictions (OPEN.md) | Requires reading conflicting claims, evaluating evidence, deciding which governs |

## 12. "DO NOT TOUCH YET" LIST

These areas should NOT be edited prematurely:

1. **The 240 `wiki-connect` warnings (bare `## Related` footers)** — Converting these requires reading both pages and deciding relationship types. Bulk conversion would introduce worse problems than it solves.

2. **Pages with `status: archived` outside archive/** — Do not change status without reading the page. Some may genuinely be pinned artifacts.

3. **Pages with retracted strings** — Do not grep-and-replace without reading context. Some mentions may be in CORRECTED blocks quoting the old claim.

4. **Empty phantom source files** — Do NOT delete. raw/ is immutable per 2026-08-13 doctrine.

5. **215 pages with old date_modified** — Do not bump dates without reading. Some may be accurate but simply not recently touched.

6. **87 pending graph candidates** — Do not mechanically add edges. Each requires reading both pages.

7. **Synthesis queue clusters** — Do not create synthesis pages without finding a governing rule.

8. **788 entity candidates** — Do not create pages without verifying identity and checking for existing pages under different names.

9. **Facebook Messenger HTML** — Do not start mining until higher-value sources (Gchat, CSVs, ChatGPT) are exhausted.

10. **Vector DB / RAG / MCP / Fancy search** — Not yet. Wait until content work stabilizes.
