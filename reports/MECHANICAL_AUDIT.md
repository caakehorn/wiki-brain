# MECHANICAL AUDIT REPORT

Generated: 2026-08-20 · Auditor: Free Agent (Yashuwa) · Revised: 2026-08-20 (review pass)
Scope: Phases 0A-0L of the Wiki-Brain mechanical audit
Corpus snapshot: **476 pages**, measured at branch commit `5355c0a`

> **READ THIS FIRST — what this document is.** Every number below is the output

## Executive Summary

The wiki has **476 pages** across **9 domains**. The graph is quantitatively healthy (3,323 prose edges) but semantically under-connected: **996 bare `related:` entries** remain untyped, **36 pages are islanded**, and the LLM manifest is **11 pages stale**.

## Priority Matrix

### P0 — Can silently corrupt or misrepresent knowledge

| Finding | Fix | Who |
|---|---|---|
| **verified** — LLM manifest stale (465 published vs 476 actual) | `bin/wiki-freshness` now detects this deterministically; run `bin/wiki-digest && bin/llm-publish` | Free |
| **verified** — Retracted `$750/week` asserted live on **1** page (`wiki/people/ally-lubin.md`) | Corrected in place 2026-08-20 with the old claim visible per STYLE_GUIDE rule 9 | done |
| **verified** — **4** empty/header-only raw files, **2** cited in `sources:` | `bin/wiki-lint` warns; a human must re-export or de-cite. Never substitute a different file | Human |

### P1 — Materially harms retrieval or provenance

| Finding | Fix | Who |
|---|---|---|
| 996 bare `related:` entries | Convert to typed connections with claims | Claude |
| 68 pages with `## Related` footers | Convert or delete | Claude |
| 36 islanded pages | Wire into graph with typed edges | Claude |
| **candidate** — 30 pages `status: archived` outside `archive/` | **Mechanically unusual, not known to be wrong.** Semantic call only | Claude |
| 215 pages with `date_modified` before 2026-08-01 | Review for currency | Claude |

### P2 — Significant quality improvement

| Finding | Fix | Who |
|---|---|---|
| 2,229 never-cited raw files | Source-mining campaigns | Claude |
| 2169 large never-cited raw files | Prioritize for extraction | Claude |
| **contested** — entity candidates with no page: **788** or **621**, see *Corrections* | Reconcile the two extractions before acting | Claude |

### P3 — Cosmetic / Low value

| Finding | Fix | Who |
|---|---|---|
| Domain pairs with 0 edges (interests <-> legal) | Cross-domain connections | Claude |
| 24 disconnected domain pairs | Build cross-domain tissue | Claude |

## Free-Agent Safe Work (Phase 1)

Per Section 24 of the plan:

1. Add duplicate YAML key lint to `bin/wiki-lint`
2. Add generated-feed CI freshness check
3. Add retracted-string gate to `bin/wiki-lint`
4. Add master-timeline generation to required precommit
5. Fix stale root counts/index metadata
6. Fix obvious stale documentation
7. Add phantom-source detection

## Claude-Required Work (Phase 2+)

Per Section 28-38 of the plan:

1. Gchat exhaustive extraction (highest ROI)
2. iMessage per-contact CSV sweep
3. 240 connection retrofit (graph candidates)
4. OPEN.md contradiction resolution
5. High-centrality synthesis review
6. People significance audit
7. Interest lifecycle audit
8. Turning-point synthesis
9. Relationship architecture synthesis
10. Current-state page creation

## Do-Not-Touch-Yet

- Agent architecture review (Phase 5) — wait until content work stabilizes
- Vector DB / RAG (Phase 5) — not yet
- MCP server (Phase 5) — not yet
- Fancy search UI (Phase 5) — not yet

## Corrections applied by the 2026-08-20 review pass

The three numbers below were wrong in the first version of this report. All
three were wrong the same way: **a mechanical match was reported as a finding.**

### 1. "Retracted `$750/week` figure still on 10 pages" → **1 page**

The scan counted every occurrence of the string. Nine of the ten were
*correctly-written corrections* — `STYLE_GUIDE.md` rule 9 requires a correction
to keep the retracted claim **visible** — plus one unrelated legitimate `$750`
(`wiki/people/david-beard.md`, an Aug 20 price negotiation) and one verbatim
quote of the December 2018 accusation the false rate was generalised from, which
is primary evidence and must stay.

Exactly **one** page asserted the retracted rate as live fact:
`wiki/people/ally-lubin.md`, *"the period whose other documented facts are …
$750/week borrowed from his mother."* Corrected 2026-08-20.

The gate in `bin/wiki-lint` now models the *claim* rather than the number and
exempts correction contexts. It reproduces this result: **1 error before the
fix, 0 after**, with no false positives across 476 pages.

### 2. "Phantom sources (10 files, 5 cited)" → **4 files, 2 cited**

Six of the ten were `.gitkeep` placeholders — empty **by design**, never cited
as evidence. The four real ones are listed in `reports/phantom-sources.md`.

The "5 cited" figure came from matching *bare filenames anywhere in page text*.
`raw/` holds **3,313 files under 1,430 distinct basenames — 1,041 basenames
collide** (`0.html`, `1.html`, thousands of exported images), so a basename can
never identify a source. Restricting the check to `sources:` frontmatter
citations, which by convention carry repo-relative paths, gives **2** genuine
citations of an empty file, both of `END_FIGHT_full.csv` (68 bytes, header
only). Pages that *mention* these filenames in prose — `source-coverage-index`
catalogues them deliberately — are correctly no longer flagged.

### 3. Entity candidates: **788 vs 621** — unresolved, do not cite either

| Report | Figure | Generated | Population |
|---|---|---|---|
| `reports/entity-candidates.md` | 788 | 2026-08-20 00:33:24 | "3+ mentions, no page", of 3,490 extracted strings |
| `reports/entities/ENTITY_CENSUS.md` | 621 | 2026-08-20 00:45:01 | "3+ mentions, no page", against 542 existing entity pages |

Two extractions twelve minutes apart, same stated criterion, 167 apart. The
generating scripts were not committed, so **neither can be reproduced and
neither is authoritative.** The review pass deliberately did not invent a third
number by re-implementing an unknown algorithm.

Both lists are also visibly noisy at the top — the highest-scoring "entities
with no page" are `New York` (195) and `Dan Frank` (161), i.e. a place name and
the subject of the entire wiki. Treat the whole list as **unfiltered
candidates**, not as a work queue.

**Next step:** write one committed extractor with a stated inclusion rule, run
it once, supersede both reports.

## Verification status of every headline number

| Number | Status | How to reproduce |
|---|---|---|
| 476 pages | verified | `bin/wiki-lint` (also `bin/wiki-freshness`) |
| 1 live retracted claim | verified | `bin/wiki-lint` + `RETRACTED.md` |
| 4 empty raw files / 2 cited | verified | `bin/wiki-lint` (warnings) |
| manifest 11 pages behind | verified | `bin/wiki-freshness` |
| 996 bare `related:` / 68 `## Related` / 36 islands | candidate | `bin/wiki-connect audit` (approximate — different tool, may differ) |
| 3,323 prose edges | candidate | not reproducible; script not committed |
| 28 climbed pages (6.1%) | candidate | `bin/wiki-climb audit` |
| 2,229 never-cited raw files | candidate | not reproducible; script not committed |
| 788 / 621 entity candidates | **contested** | not reproducible; see above |
| 30 archived-outside-archive | candidate | `reports/archive-status-audit.md` |
| 215 pages `date_modified` < 2026-08-01 | candidate | not reproducible; script not committed |
