## Recommendations

1. **Priority 1:** Convert 996 bare `related:` entries to typed `connections:` with claims
2. **Priority 2:** Delete or convert 68 `## Related` footers
3. **Priority 3:** Wire 36 islanded pages into the graph with typed edges
4. **Priority 4:** Address disconnected domain pairs (interests <-> legal has 0 edges)

Note: This is a mechanical audit. Deciding relationship types and writing claims requires Claude judgment.
