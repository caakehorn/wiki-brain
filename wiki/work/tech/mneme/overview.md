# MNEME — Personal Memory Corpus Platform

A full product spec, dated April 2026, for a tool that solves the exact
problem this wiki itself exists to solve: the "cold-start" problem of
every LLM session beginning with zero context about who its user is. Dan
frames existing approaches (pasting bios into system prompts, RAG) as
solving the wrong layer — retrieval instead of **extraction and
synthesis** — and specs MNEME as a guided self-knowledge-extraction
engine that converts free-form "storytime" narrative into a structured,
versioned "bootloader document" injectable into any LLM's context.

## The five-layer corpus model

The build kit's core intellectual contribution is a layered ontology for
personal context, ordered by "blast radius" — how much of an LLM's
downstream behavior each layer changes — rather than by topic:

| Layer | Content | Example field |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| 1. Life circumstances | Relationship/dependent/employment/geographic status | "married with two kids under 6" changes every recommendation |
| 2. Biographical substrate | Formative history explaining the present | family of origin, career arc, opt-in trauma-adjacent events |
| 3. Ideological/axiological map | Beliefs ranked by **conviction strength**, not flat-listed | "holds X with high conviction, won't update without substantial evidence" |
| 4. Cognitive style | How the person thinks, inferred from behavior rather than self-report | reasoning style, update triggers, bias patterns |
| 5. Stylometric/cultural signature | How they write, what they reject as much as what they like | voice register, anti-tastes, subcultural affiliation |

Layer 3's "conviction strength" requirement and Layer 5's "anti-profile"
(what the user is explicitly *not*, often more useful than positive
assertions) are the spec's sharpest ideas — both map directly onto
choices this wiki has independently made elsewhere (e.g. distinguishing
`knowledge: earned` conclusions from `derived` facts, or documenting
Dan's political trajectory by what he rejects as much as what he holds).

## Extraction method and build plan

Input runs through "storytime mode" (open narrative prompts, funneled
large-to-small, explicitly banning direct "what are your values"
questions as generating performative rather than real answers) plus
adversarial elicitation for the belief/cognitive layers (value-conflict
scenarios, forced ranking of previously stated positions). The technical
plan is deliberately minimal: a single self-contained HTML file built
inside Google AI Studio's canvas environment, no server, no API key
management, local-only storage via localStorage/IndexedDB treated as a
privacy feature given the sensitivity of what it stores (relationships,
ideology, health). A ten-session build sequence is specified end to end,
from JSON-schema locking through a pure-SVG five-layer radar-chart
visualization, with Phase 3 explicitly scoped to import prior Claude/
ChatGPT chat exports.

## Why this page exists

MNEME is Dan externalizing, as a buildable product, the same insight this
wiki already operationalizes: that self-knowledge has to be *extracted and
synthesized once*, not endlessly re-derived from raw source material —
this wiki's own "second brain, not a RAG" framing
([[wiki/self/context-core]], the project's own `CLAUDE.md`) is the same
thesis MNEME's problem statement states almost verbatim. It sits alongside
[[wiki/work/tech/max-framework/overview]] and
[[wiki/mind/concepts/exocortex]] as another instance of Dan building
external cognitive infrastructure for himself, and is the clearest
evidence yet that the wiki-brain project and Dan's own product instincts
are pointed at the same problem independently.

**Gaps:** no evidence in the corpus of MNEME actually being built past
the spec stage; unclear whether this predates or postdates his adoption
of this wiki-brain project as his personal solution to the same problem.
