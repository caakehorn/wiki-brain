# Arnu

**Role:** Contractor (painter/mechanical work) at 463 Morgantown St. Mechanics lien deadline ~July 27 2026. Associated with Felix (co-worker/painter, possibly supply-adjacent per MAX_PRIME).

## Roles, Dates, Evidence Table

| Contractor | Work Type / Evidence | Dates | Financial/Legal Ties | Notes / Source |
|------------|----------------------|-------|----------------------|---------------|
| Arnu | Paint / home work at 463; no-show noted | 2026-02-10: "Felix showed up but Arnu didn’t. He’s bringing Elijah over to do his homework until basketball practice and Felix is going to paint more." | Mechanics lien ~2026-07-27 (critical) | Suz comms (iMessage via +17243228715); [[wiki/legal/463-morgantown]] |
| Felix (assoc.) | Paint execution; showed when Arnu absent | 2026-02-10 (same thread) | N/A direct; "supply-adjacent figure" in MAX_PRIME | Paired in property activity; Elijah (homework/basketball) context |
| John Carney (parallel) | General contractor work | ~10-20% complete; unreachable as of 2026-03 | Incomplete work exposure; "John carney thing" analysis | Shared with Suz 2026-03-27 |
| Jackson Alexander | Owner oversight | Property title | Lien attaches to title | [[wiki/people/alexander-jackson]] |

## Timeline Snippets

- 2026-02-10: Arnu no-show for painting; Felix arrives with Elijah (homework/paint). Direct evidence in raw message-csv.
- ~2026 (pre-03): John Carney work status discussed ("I just read the John carney thing").
- ~2026-07-27: Arnu lien deadline (risk node if unresolved).
- Ongoing 2026: 463 occupancy post-337 sale move; contractor work parallel to BFS period.

## Behavioral / Core Notes

Property work occurs amid [[wiki/self/context-core]] housing transition and [[wiki/mind/synthesis/vertical-authority-skepticism]] (caretaker ambiguities + off-books patterns from BFS extend to housing contractors). Vertical authority skepticism applies to owner/contractor relations without clear lease/POA. "Arnu didn’t" fits low-trust execution gaps noted in core (Si-tertiary archival + anomaly focus).

Felix named in MAX_PRIME as "supply-adjacent figure" (2026 appearance); context here is domestic/paint labor at 463. Cross with [[wiki/mind/synthesis/vertical-authority-skepticism]].

**Notes:** Direct data thin beyond one key Suz message + wiki timeline references (derived from operating/core). No deep personal bio. Defer to raw message-csv and future legal docs for liens/contracts. Expand on Elijah/Felix ties if surfaced. "John carney thing" suggests prior forensic analysis shared.

> **DEADLINE ELAPSED [2026-08-02].** The ~27 July 2026 mechanics-lien date this

> estimate derived from the February 2026 work window, not a documented filing —
> nothing on disk contains a lien notice, a contract, or a dollar figure for
> Arnu's work. Whether it was filed, settled, or never real is unresolved. See

**Premise re-check (2026-07-26):** [[wiki/legal/463-morgantown]] moved on 2026-07-18 in a typed-connections pass; no fact this page depends on changed. The mechanics-lien deadline it records, ~2026-07-27, is now imminent and remains unresolved in every source read so far.

## RE-CHECKED [2026-08-18]

`bin/wiki-climb check` flagged this page stale against
[[wiki/legal/463-morgantown]], moved 2026-08-18 for a correction to
[[wiki/people/suzanne-frank|Suz's]] financial position and two new dated rows.

**Nothing here is contradicted.** The estimated ~27 July 2026 mechanics-lien
deadline remains unobserved, and the question of whether it was filed, settled
or never real is still open and still answerable from a Fayette County
prothonotary search. The one thing the correction changes is the assessment of
consequence: the 463 page previously reasoned that a lien-sized shock had no
obvious absorber because Suz's finances were "cyclical." They are not cyclical —
she filed Chapter 13 in October 2024 with roughly $157,000 scheduled and
liquidated her only unencumbered asset in June 2026 to service it. If the lien
was filed, there is no absorber at all.
