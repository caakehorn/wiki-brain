# Trait–corpus map

Part of [[wiki/mind/profile/index]] — the measured counterpart to the
self-report scores it collects.

> **GENERATED — do not hand-edit.** `bin/wiki-traits page` writes this file;
> an edit here fails `bin/wiki-traits check`. It is **evidence, not a claim**:
> it states no finding about Dan. A finding drawn from it reaches an ordinary
> page through the normal operations.

Every trait in `wiki/mind/profile/` tested against 138,249 sent messages
(controlled against 135,443 received from other handles), 2,741 tweets,
1,456 ChatGPT prompts and 3,986 Gemini prompts —
then against the wiki's own reasoning, separately and never pooled.

## The two axes, and why they are never added

**Support** is Tier A: Dan's own behavioural output, produced without knowing
what this wiki would say. It is the only tier that can corroborate anything.

**Reach** is Tier C: how much of the wiki already leans on the trait. It is
**not evidence and never becomes evidence.** These pages were written by agents
that had read `wiki/mind/profile/`, so reach measures how often the writing
process reached for a vocabulary — not how present the trait is in the life.
Of 483 entries, 122 carry personality vocabulary and 38 of 61 synthesis pages do.

**Silence is not falsification.** A trait can be real and leave no lexical
trace; people do not narrate their own architecture in text messages. `silent`
means the corpus does not carry it, and constrains how much weight a synthesis
may place on it — nothing more. Only `INVERTED` is evidence against a score.
There is no confidence percentage on this page and one must never be added.

## The state of the instrument

Of 23 lexical proxies, **1 has been reviewed and found sound**, 6 were
reviewed and found broken, and 16 have never had their matches read.

A proxy earns its verdict by having had its matches actually read. **An unreviewed
proxy may not confirm a score and may not contradict one** — a result that would
have been either is reported as `unreviewed` instead. That is a different band from
`silent`, and the difference matters: *silent* means an instrument ran and found
nothing, *unreviewed* means no trustworthy instrument ran, and *no instrument* means
every proxy built for the trait was read and found to measure something else. Three
positions, three names, never collapsed. The cap exists because the heaviest verdict
in this system is also the cheapest to manufacture: a regex that catches the wrong
side of a conversation inverts trivially. The first run of this tool reported
`CONTRADICTED LOAD` on the Fe deficit — an instruction to re-read 37 pages, 17 of
them synthesis — on a proxy for *other-directed concern* whose every match was Dan
being comforted: *"Thank you for making me feel better sweetie."* The pattern caught
`feel better` and could not tell who was doing the feeling.

`bin/wiki-traits review` is the queue. Each broken proxy names the string that
breaks it.

## What the map obliges

7 trait(s) sit in a cell that constrains what a synthesis may do.

### NO INSTRUMENT / LOAD — Vulnerability at the 78th percentile

Cite as testimony, never as measurement, and say so on the page. Every proxy built for this trait was read and found to catch something else. The wiki leans on it anyway.

- **Support:** no instrument
- **Reach:** 49 pages, 12 of them synthesis, 25 citing `wiki/mind/profile/big-five-psychometrics.md`
- **Constitution register 2**

  - `overwhelm` — 0.96x vs control, n=318, excluded

### UNREVIEWED LOAD — Ti dominance (introverted thinking lead)

Cite as testimony, never as measurement. The wiki leans on this and no proxy for it has had its matches read, so the instrument cannot yet confirm or contradict it. Reviewing them is owed work: `bin/wiki-traits review`.

- **Support:** unreviewed
- **Reach:** 48 pages, 25 of them synthesis, 43 citing `wiki/mind/profile/intp.md`
- **Constitution register 1**

  - `conditional reasoning` — 1.56x vs control, n=43, unreviewed
  - `explicit confidence %` — 17.64x vs control, n=18, too few
  - `probability quantification` — 2.05x vs control, n=23, unreviewed

### UNREVIEWED LOAD — Liberalism at the 91st percentile

Cite as testimony, never as measurement. The wiki leans on this and no proxy for it has had its matches read, so the instrument cannot yet confirm or contradict it. Reviewing them is owed work: `bin/wiki-traits review`.

- **Support:** unreviewed — replicates in chatgpt, twitter
- **Reach:** 46 pages, 28 of them synthesis, 13 citing `wiki/mind/politics/axioms.md`
- **Constitution register 11**

  - `political register` — 1.42x vs control, n=55, unreviewed

### NO INSTRUMENT / LOAD — Fe deficit (absent relational grading)

Cite as testimony, never as measurement, and say so on the page. Every proxy built for this trait was read and found to catch something else. The wiki leans on it anyway.

- **Support:** no instrument
- **Reach:** 35 pages, 17 of them synthesis, 43 citing `wiki/mind/profile/intp.md`
- **Constitution register 1**

  - `offering help unprompted` — 1.81x vs control, n=372, excluded
  - `other-directed concern` — 2.72x vs control, n=311, excluded
  - `sympathy tokens` — 0.49x vs control, n=57, excluded

### NO INSTRUMENT / LOAD — Impulsiveness at the 96th percentile

Cite as testimony, never as measurement, and say so on the page. Every proxy built for this trait was read and found to catch something else. The wiki leans on it anyway.

- **Support:** no instrument — replicates in chatgpt, gemini, twitter
- **Reach:** 34 pages, 13 of them synthesis, 25 citing `wiki/mind/profile/big-five-psychometrics.md`
- **Constitution register 2**

  - `immediacy / right-now` — 1.05x vs control, n=1140, excluded

### UNREVIEWED LOAD — Anxiety at the 67th percentile

Cite as testimony, never as measurement. The wiki leans on this and no proxy for it has had its matches read, so the instrument cannot yet confirm or contradict it. Reviewing them is owed work: `bin/wiki-traits review`.

- **Support:** unreviewed — replicates in chatgpt
- **Reach:** 29 pages, 7 of them synthesis, 25 citing `wiki/mind/profile/big-five-psychometrics.md`
- **Constitution register 2**

  - `worry` — 1.32x vs control, n=465, unreviewed

### UNREVIEWED LOAD — Schizotypal at 79 (pattern cognition)

Cite as testimony, never as measurement. The wiki leans on this and no proxy for it has had its matches read, so the instrument cannot yet confirm or contradict it. Reviewing them is owed work: `bin/wiki-traits review`.

- **Support:** unreviewed
- **Reach:** 26 pages, 6 of them synthesis, 19 citing `wiki/mind/profile/deviance-mapping.md`
- **Constitution register 2**

  - `pattern / conspiracy cognition` — 2.04x vs control, n=27, unreviewed

## What is not measured

- **Facebook.** 286 MB and 1,686 HTML files, and the export is nested inside
  itself — a second copy of `posts/your_posts_1.html` sits one directory down,
  so counting the tree as it stands double-counts every post. A real fifth
  register, absent for a stated reason rather than by oversight.
- **Non-lexical expression.** Every proxy here is a regex over text. A trait
  expressed in what Dan *did* rather than what he wrote is invisible to this
  instrument, and that invisibility is what `silent` records.
- **The instrument scores themselves are Tier B testimony** — self-report, the
  claim rather than support for it. Their standing is the testimony ledger's.
