# Calibrated Confidence

Dan Frank attaches **graded numeric probabilities to his own beliefs in casual
text messages**, and he is effectively the only person in the corpus who does
it. Across 106,629 outbound messages spanning 2015–2025 he writes a numeric
confidence attached to an assertion — *"I'm 90% sure I will have z when she
does," "Like 80% sure these were not hers," "I feel 0% confident about how it
could go"* — 43 times. Across the 110,944 inbound messages from 503 other
handles, it happens **twice**.

The raw ratio understates it, and the interesting number is a different one.

## The measurement

| | Dan (outbound) | Everyone else (inbound) |
|---|---|---|
| Messages | 106,629 | 110,944 |
| Numeric confidence attached to a belief | **43** | **2** |
| Of those, plain "100%" | 27 | 2 |
| **Graded values (not 0 / 50 / 100)** | **15** | **0** |
| Distinct values used | 0, 75, 80, 89, 90, 95, 99, 99.9999, 99.99999999, 100 | 100 |

Both inbound instances are the idiomatic "100%" that functions as a synonym for
*definitely* — "100% convinced he has it." That is ordinary English and carries
no arithmetic. What does not occur even once in a decade of other people's
messages is a **value between the endpoints**: 75, 80, **89**, 90, 95. Eighty-nine
per cent is the tell. Nobody reaches for 89% as an intensifier; 89% is an
estimate.

So the finding is not that Dan says "100% sure" more often than his friends. It
is that Dan is using the *scale* and everyone else is using a word.

## Re-derived 2026-08-23: the counts do not reproduce, the asymmetry does, and the test is not runnable

> **CORRECTED [2026-08-23].** This page's measurement table gave **43 outbound
> instances against 2 inbound**, and **15 graded (non-endpoint) values against
> zero**. Re-derived from the on-disk CSVs — 98,228 deduped Dan-sent messages
> against 91,858 received — **none of the four numbers reproduces, and the
> "zero" is false.** The direction and rough magnitude of the finding survive;
> the arithmetic does not, and the reason is that the original filter was
> counting things that are not credences.

**The original filter swept in everything with a percent sign near a
belief-word.** A permissive re-run returns **99** Dan-sent instances, not 43 —
and inspecting them shows why the number is meaningless in either direction.
The catch includes population shares (*"more than 99% of customers"*, *"99.999%
of people"*), a cited opinion poll (*"64% of Israelis"*), a retail discount
(*"40% off at the golf academy"*), plain proportions (*"a good 90% of what I was
saying"*, *"75% of the time"*), and rhetorical framings that assert no credence
at all (*"if there's even a 1% chance"*). None of those is a probability
estimate about a proposition, which is the thing this page exists to claim.

**Under a strict, symmetric filter — a first-person credence of the form "I am
N% sure/certain/confident" or "there's an N% chance that ⟨clause⟩", with
population shares and cited statistics excluded, applied identically to both
directions:**

| | Dan (outbound) | Everyone else (inbound) |
|---|---:|---:|
| Messages | 98,228 | 91,858 |
| Strict credences | **60** | **4** |
| Of those, graded (not 0/50/100) | **24** | **2** |
| Rate per 100,000 messages (graded) | **24.4** | **2.2** |

**And one of the two inbound graded instances is not an instance.** The
2025-09-04 entry is a tapback reading *"Loved '98% sure that's because it's
either old camera or…'"* — somebody quoting Dan's own message back at him.
Removing it leaves **one** genuine graded credence from 503 other people across
eleven years: *"she said that she needs space which I'm 99% sure that I'm
fucked"* (2026-02-27).

So the corrected finding is **24 against 1**, a rate ratio near 22× rather than
the infinite one the "zero" implied. **The thesis holds** — Dan uses the scale
and almost nobody else does — and it is now a claim that has survived a filter
designed to break it, which is worth more than the larger number it replaces.

### The calibration test is not runnable, and that is the finding

[[wiki/mind/synthesis/failure-to-launch]] named scoring these instances against
outcomes as the highest-value cheap experiment in the profile cluster, on the
reasoning that the data already existed. **It does not.** Reading all 24 strict
graded credences, they sort into three groups and only one is scoreable even in
principle:

- **Claims about another person's interior** — *"90% sure those are sarcastic
  apologies"*, *"98.7% sure you don't believe any of your catholicism"*,
  *"99% sure you're a no"*. Unfalsifiable by construction.
- **Claims about unwitnessed past events** — *"95% sure she quit and didn't tell
  anyone"*, *"99% sure it was a sedative in that"*, *"99% sure it's her"*. No
  resolution exists anywhere in the corpus.
- **Forward-looking claims about the world** — and there are almost none.

**Exactly one instance in eleven years is resolvable from the corpus, and it
resolved false.** On 2018-08-08 Dan writes *"I am 75% sure this is my last
summer at Nemacolin."* [[wiki/work/nemacolin-caddying]] dates the job **April
2016 – November 2019** per his own resume: he worked the 2019 season too. A 75%
forecast that did not happen.

n = 1 is not a calibration test and this page will not pretend otherwise. What
the re-derivation establishes is sharper and less flattering than the experiment
would have been: **the habit is real and rare, and it is aimed almost entirely
at propositions that can never be scored.** Using the scale is a genuine
cognitive signature. Using it where it could be checked is a different skill,
and the corpus contains one attempt at it.

**What would settle it.** A prospective log — any forward-dated prediction with
a resolution date attached, recorded from now — produces a scoreable set inside
months. Nothing retrospective will, and that is now a closed question rather
than an open gap.

## Why it survives the obvious objections

Three alternative explanations were tested against the corpus and none holds.

**It is not one relationship.** The 43 instances spread across **12 distinct
handles**. [[wiki/people/annie-ulmer|Annie]] takes the largest share at 13, which
is roughly her share of the corpus generally, so this is not a private register
developed inside the primary relationship.

**It is not an era.** It appears in **every single year the dump covers** —
2015 (1), 2016 (6), 2017 (4), 2018 (8), 2019 (5), 2020 (7), 2023 (1), 2024 (4),
2025 (7). It predates the AI-collaboration period by eight years, which matters
because it means the habit was not learned from talking to models. If anything
the models met a mind that already worked this way.

**It is not numeracy in general.** Bare percentages of any kind — prices, tips,
battery, odds — run at 2.94 per thousand outbound against 2.16 inbound, a ratio
of only 1.36×. Dan is barely more numerate than his correspondents in ordinary
usage. The divergence is specific to **percentages pointed at his own mental
state**, where the ratio is 22×.

## What it means

The wiki's psychological layer is built largely on instruments and on AI
sessions: [[wiki/mind/profile/big-five-psychometrics|Intellect at 95]],
Ti-dominance, "reality parsed as a high-fidelity system,"
[[wiki/mind/concepts/forensic-method|the forensic method]], and
[[wiki/mind/concepts/dans-law|Dan's Law]] — a heuristic that opens by asking
whether the joint probability of a coincidence cluster is near zero. All of that
is asserted in venues where Dan was being asked about himself, or was
constructing a self-description on purpose.

This is the same architecture caught with nobody watching. Texting a friend
about whether a coworker quit, he does not write *I think* — he writes *I am 95%
sure, based on what RT said*, and appends his evidence. The probabilistic frame
is not a method he adopts when doing analysis. It is the resting state of the
sentence.

Two details sharpen it. The first is **0% confident** (January 2018) — the scale
runs downward as well as upward, which an intensifier cannot do. The second is
the absurd tail: *"99.9999% sure," "99.9999999999999999% sure you don't."*
Stacking nines past any possible warrant is a joke, but it is a joke that only
works if the underlying scale is real to the person telling it — he is
exaggerating along an axis he actually uses.

## Prediction

If this is a genuine cognitive signature rather than a verbal tic, it should
appear **wherever Dan writes and nowhere that he does not**. The falsifiable
form: graded numeric confidence should be findable at comparable or higher rates
in his email, Facebook Messenger, Reddit and forum output, and in the
`raw/self/chats/` AI sessions — and it should remain near-absent in the inbound
half of every one of those corpora. If a scan of the Facebook Messenger export
returns Dan at the inbound baseline instead, then the habit is
iMessage-specific, this page is measuring a channel rather than a mind, and the
claim should be narrowed to the channel.

## The prediction, run against the public archive — partly, and it does not settle

Added 2026-09-04 from [[wiki/self/twitter]]. **The Prediction section above
names a test and the corpus already held a fifth channel it did not list**: the
public twitter archive, 2,718 originals across seventeen years, written for an
audience rather than to one person.

**Result 1 — the strict pattern returns zero, and that is not a refutation.**
This page's own pattern (a numeric percentage adjacent to *sure / certain /
positive / confident / convinced*) finds **0 instances in 2,718 public posts**.
At the outbound-message rate of 43 per 106,629 — 0.40 per thousand — a corpus
this size predicts roughly **one**. Observing zero when the expectation is one
is what the same rate looks like about a third of the time. **The test as
specified is underpowered on this archive and cannot distinguish "the habit is
absent in public" from "the archive is too small to show it."** Stated plainly
because the zero is tempting to over-read in either direction.

**Result 2 — he is not less numerate in public.** The bare-percentage control
runs at **3.68 per thousand public posts against 2.94 per thousand outbound
messages.** Whatever the strict zero means, it is not that percentages stop
appearing when there is an audience.

**Result 3 — the decisive control cannot be run here at all, ever.** The
finding above rests on a 22× outbound-to-inbound asymmetry: Dan does this and
his correspondents do not. **A broadcast archive has no inbound half.** No
volume of twitter data can supply that comparison, so this channel can furnish
instances and can never confirm or refute the asymmetry that makes them mean
anything.

### What the pattern cannot see, and it is the actual finding

Graded confidence *is* in the public archive. It is pointed somewhere else.

| Date | Post |
|---|---|
| 2021-01-07 | *"i'm as sure as i could possibly be that the capitol police had arranged to allow the chuds into the building"* |
| 2022-02-26 | *"While still incredibly unlikely, it's clear that the post-cold war era of geopolitical order is changing"* |
| 2022-07-01 | *"There is a 0% chance that he would not actively work [against a primary challenger]"* |
| 2023-03-15 | *"there's an astronomically high probability that, in the last 12 hours, you've liked tweets from both Ben Shapiro and Jordan Peterson"* |
| 2024-07-06 | *"it's 25% at best for Kamala, Gretch, Newsom"* |
| 2024-07-20 | *"There's about a 100% chance President Brainrot thinks that he's got a real life leprechaun on staff"* |

**In private he grades his own mental state; in public he grades the world.**
*"I am 95% sure"* is a number about Dan. *"it's 25% at best for Kamala"* is a
number about an election. Same scale, same granularity, same willingness to run
it to the endpoints — a different object, and this page's pattern is built to
catch the first and structurally blind to the second. That is a real
distinction rather than an artefact: it is what the medium selects for. Nobody
broadcasts their own certainty to an audience that did not ask; a forecast is
the form a probability takes when it is addressed to strangers.

### Two behaviours the message corpus does not contain

Both are stronger evidence than another instance would be, because a scale you
merely *use* is a habit and a scale you **enforce and audit against** is a norm.

**He polices calibration in other people.** On **2022-03-30**: *"That's a level
of certainty I'm not sure how you've arrived at."* And on **2022-02-24**, of a
casualty figure early in the Ukraine invasion: *"This kind of specific and not
large number seem a little sus to me, though I do appreciate the need to
inspire confidence and galvanize a terrified nation."* The second is a
suspiciously-precise-number objection — the failure mode of somebody who thinks
about what a number is entitled to claim.

**He audits his own past confidence, unprompted and against himself.** On
**2024-11-07**, after the election: *"Pretty crazy that even I, someone who was
really pessimistic about the probability of a Biden re-elect, was still giving
him blue wall states in June."* He is not reporting the outcome; he is
reporting that his own estimate was insufficiently pessimistic, and dating it.

**The 2022 hole is partly filled.** The Gaps section below records the message
dump as missing 2022 and 2026 entirely. The archive has **158 originals in
2022**, three of them in the table above, so the terminal-phase gap is narrower
than it was — for this channel, on this behaviour, and not for the asymmetry.

**What would settle it.** The Facebook Messenger and email exports, which are
addressed to individuals and therefore *do* have an inbound half. Those remain
the real test, exactly as the Prediction section says.

## Accuracy is no longer untested — but read what was tested

This page's own typed edge carries the caveat *"expression is measured while
accuracy remains untested."* That has been true since the page was written and
it stopped being true on **2026-09-02**, when
[[wiki/meta/testimony-veracity|the testimony ledger]] began recording
first-person claims with **the confidence he expressed** and adjudicating them
against evidence. As of 2026-09-04 it holds **12 settled claims on 35.0 weight**:

| | |
|---|---|
| Veracity | **51 / 100** — outcome value 0.52 |
| Clean-confirmation rate | 19%–68% (95% Wilson) |
| **Brier** | **0.323** |
| **Skill vs a coin flip** | **−0.29** |
| Stated-vs-actual gap | **−0.26, over-confident** |
| The `certain` band | says 0.95, **is 0.25** (n=4) |
| The `confident` band | says 0.80, is 0.69 (n=4) |

**The headline is that his confidence is not currently informative** — a Brier
worse than chance means a reader who inverted his certainty would have done
better than one who trusted it — **and that the failure is concentrated in the
`certain` band**, which is exactly backwards from what a well-calibrated
grader looks like.

### The population is not the same one, and the difference is the whole caveat

**This page is about a specific verbal habit**: 43 instances of a *numeric*
probability attached to an assertion in a text message, against 2 in 110,944
inbound. **The ledger scores a different set**: first-person claims of any kind,
with confidence recorded on a four-band ordinal scale (`certain`/`confident`/
`hedged`/`unsure`) assigned at record time. The two overlap — both are him
signalling how sure he is — and they are not the same population, so **the
ledger does not settle this page's claim.** What it does is remove the excuse
that no measurement is possible, and supply the first one that exists.

**And n is small.** Twelve settled claims, four in the `certain` band. A Brier
on n=12 is a direction, not a verdict, and the ledger says so itself by
refusing any class under its own minimum as a prior. **Nothing on this page is
withdrawn.** The expression claim — that he does this and almost nobody else
does — is residue and is untouched.

### One directional finding is firm enough to subtract

Across every settled claim the ledger holds, errors of placement run **one
way**: **4× `early`, 0× `late`.** Where he misdates something he puts it
*before* the truth, and there is not yet a single counterexample. The newest is
`t018` — asked in December 2018 when [[wiki/people/rob-orange]] died, he
answers *"2013?"* against a contemporaneous 2014-04-11 anchor.

That is the useful kind of error, and this page is the right place to say so:
**a bias with a direction is subtractable in a way an error rate is not.** A
reader of this corpus who moves his undated recollections slightly later will be
right more often than one who takes them as given.

## Gaps

The 43 instances are the yield of one pattern — numeric confidence adjacent to
*sure / certain / positive / confident / convinced*. Adjacent constructions the
pattern does not catch (*"odds are," "there's a good chance," "I'd bet,"
"probably"*) are unmeasured, and a hedging-word study would put this finding on
a much larger base; the 1.36× bare-percentage control suggests the effect is
real but its true size is unknown. The dump covers 2015–2025 with **2022 and
2026 entirely missing**, so nothing here speaks to the terminal phase or the
July 2026 re-contact. Whether the habit is inherited, learned, or the residue of
something specific is not addressed anywhere in the corpus — no message explains
where it came from, and no source in `raw/` records anyone else in the family
doing it.
