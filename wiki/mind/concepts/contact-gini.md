# Contact Gini

The coefficient is generalised in [[wiki/mind/synthesis/single-channel]]:
the same concentration appears in the creative, cognitive and evaluative
domains, and the architecture it describes has no failover.

The "Contact Gini" concept refers to the application of the Gini coefficient to measure the concentration of Dan's relational load. It quantifies the degree to which his relational and emotional inputs are routed through a statistically single external communication node, rather than being distributed across a broader social network.

## RECOMPUTED 2026-08-01 — the figure holds, the constancy does not

> **The 0.961 coefficient was quoted from a profile document and had never been
> recomputed.** It has now been recomputed directly from
> `raw/self/message-csv/MASTER_MESSAGES_DB_DUMP.csv` — 184,359 rows, of which
> 105,405 carry a contact handle. **Result: 0.9601 across 496 unique handles.**
> The quoted figure survives to three decimal places and the handle count
> matches exactly. This metric is no longer testimony; it is residue.

What the recomputation also shows — and what a single lifetime number
concealed — is that **the concentration is not a constant.** Computed per year:

| Year | Messages | Handles | Gini | Top-1 share |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2015 | 6,488 | 11 | 0.9019 | 98.6% |
| 2016 | 10,207 | 24 | 0.9047 | 60.3% |
| 2017 | 8,786 | 64 | 0.9268 | 84.4% |
| 2018 | 20,277 | 145 | 0.9356 | 55.3% |
| 2019 | 10,612 | 187 | 0.9024 | 42.8% |
| 2020 | 3,155 | 107 | **0.8409** | **25.4%** |
| 2023 | 452 | 32 | **0.7460** | 47.6% |
| 2024 | 2,198 | 48 | 0.8633 | 34.0% |
| 2025 | 33,214 | 70 | **0.9576** | 49.9% |
| 2026 | 9,884 | 19 | 0.8928 | 70.8% |

Lifetime top-1 share is **29.6%**; lifetime **top-5 share is 70.1%** — five
handles carry seven-tenths of the entire archive.

Three readings, in descending confidence:

1. **The lifetime figure is real.** 0.9601 is not an artifact of one era. It is
   high in every year measured, never dropping below 0.746.
2. **It tightens under load.** The highest-concentration full year is **2025 at
   0.9576 — also by far the highest-volume year at 33,214 messages**, and the
   year of the collapse. The lowest is 2020 at 0.8409. Concentration is not a
   fixed trait; it responds.
3. **The early years cannot carry weight.** 2015 shows 11 handles and a 98.6%
   top-1 share, which is a statement about export coverage, not about a social
   world. Years before 2015 and the 2021–22 window fall below the 200-message
   floor entirely.

### The nulls are not random — resolved 2026-08-01

The 69,953 unattributed rows have been characterised, and they are **not**
randomly distributed. **69,869 of them — 99.88% — are `Sent`.**

| | Received | Sent |
|---|---|---|
| has a handle | 86,286 | 19,119 |
| **blank handle** | 84 | **69,869** |

The export drops the recipient on outbound messages. Inbound is essentially
fully attributed (99.9%); **outbound is 78.5% unattributed.** The blank rate
sits near 50% every year through 2024, then falls to 20% in 2025 and 0% in 2026
— a change in export method, not a change in behaviour.

**Therefore the 0.9601 figure is a received-side coefficient.** It measures the
concentration of who *contacts Dan*, not the concentration of the whole
relational load. That is a real and useful quantity, and it is not the quantity
the page previously implied. Three consequences:

1. **The headline number must be restated**, not withdrawn: *inbound* contact
   Gini 0.9601 over 496 handles.
2. **The finding survives on the best-attributed data.** 2025 is 80% attributed
   and 2026 is 100%, and they still show 0.9576 and 0.8928 — so the
   concentration is not an artifact of the missing outbound side, it is merely
   measured on one side.
3. ~~**Outbound concentration remains unmeasured.** Whether Dan *sends* as
   concentratedly as he *receives* is unknown, and a person can plausibly have a
   narrow inbound funnel and a wide outbound one.~~ **SETTLED 2026-08-01 — the
   architecture is symmetric.** See the next section. The narrow-in/wide-out
   alternative is falsified; the clause is left visible because it was the
   hypothesis the measurement was built to kill.

~~**Next operation:** recipients are likely recoverable by pairing each `Sent`
row to the surrounding conversation window in the same export. That would produce
the first true two-sided coefficient, and it is the only way to settle whether
the architecture is symmetric.~~ **DONE 2026-08-01.**

## TWO-SIDED 2026-08-01 — the concentration is not a receiving posture

The recipient recovery was run. **The architecture is symmetric.** Dan sends as
concentratedly as he receives, and he sends to *fewer* people than write to him.

### Method

Each `Sent` row was paired to the nearest attributed `Received` rows on either
side of it in the same export, on the assumption that an outbound message sits
inside the conversation window it belongs to. Two rules were tested — `bracket`
(assign only when the attributed neighbours on *both* sides fall within the
window and name the same handle) and `nearest` (assign the closest attributed
neighbour within the window).

Only attributed `Received` rows were used as context. The **19,119 `Sent` rows
that do carry a handle were held out entirely** and never used as context, so
validation and deployment run under identical conditions.

| Rule | Window | Coverage | Accuracy |
|---|---|---|---|
| bracket | 5 min | 50.3% | **97.7%** |
| bracket | 30 min | 67.4% | **96.6%** |
| bracket | 1 hr | 72.4% | 95.9% |
| nearest | 1 hr | 96.7% | 88.0% |
| nearest | 24 hr | 100.0% | 86.8% |

**Control:** always guessing that year's single busiest handle scores 57.2%.
The method is not riding on concentration — `bracket`@30min beats the modal
guess by 39 points.

Two limits on the validation, both real. The held-out rows are **2025–26 only**
(19,115 of 19,119), because those are the only years the export attributes
outbound at all — so accuracy is *directly* verified only for the recent window.
To reach the earlier years, the same rules were run leave-one-out against the
attributed `Received` rows, where ground truth exists for every year:
`bracket`@30min scores 93.1%–99.4% accuracy in every year from 2015 to 2026.
That is a proxy — imputing an inbound from inbound context is an easier task
than imputing an outbound — but it establishes that the conversation-window
structure is locally coherent throughout the archive, not just recently.

### The bias check, which decides how the numbers may be quoted

Imputation error is not neutral with respect to the thing being measured.
Comparing, on the held-out rows only, the Gini of the *true* handles against the
Gini of the *imputed* handles for the same messages:

| Rule | Gini (true) | Gini (imputed) | Bias |
|---|---|---|---|
| bracket @ 30 min | 0.7546 | 0.7771 | **+0.0225** |
| nearest @ 1 hr | 0.7739 | 0.8734 | **+0.0996** |

**Imputation inflates concentration.** Misassignment invents handles that were
never the recipient, which lengthens the tail and pushes the coefficient up.
Every imputed outbound figure below is therefore an **upper bound**, and the
high-coverage `nearest` rule is the worse instrument despite looking better on
coverage. This is why the argument does not rest on the imputed numbers.

### The anchor: 2026 requires no imputation at all

The export's attribution improves to completeness at the end. In **2026, 99.8%
of `Sent` rows and 99.9% of `Received` rows carry a handle** — a fully
two-sided year, measured, nothing inferred:

| 2026 (verified, no imputation) | Messages | Handles | Gini |
|---|---|---|---|
| Inbound | 4,046 | 18 | 0.8748 |
| **Outbound** | **5,838** | **10** | **0.8119** |
| Two-sided | 9,884 | 19 | 0.8928 |

He sent *more* messages than he received, to **ten handles against eighteen**.
Outbound top-1 share is 73.5% and top-5 is 99.2%. There is no wide outbound
spread in the one year where the question can be answered without a model.

### The whole archive, with recipients recovered

| Rule | Outbound rows placed | Inbound Gini | Outbound Gini | Two-sided Gini |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| bracket @ 30 min | 68,822 (77%) | 0.9544 | 0.9347 | **0.9636** |
| nearest @ 1 hr | 87,043 (98%) | 0.9544 | 0.9425 | **0.9599** |
| nearest @ 24 hr | 88,856 (99.9%) | 0.9544 | 0.9441 | **0.9591** |

The three operating points span 0.9591–0.9636 on the two-sided figure despite
placing between 77% and 99.9% of the outbound side, which means the result is
not sensitive to how much of the missing side gets filled in. For reference:
inbound alone is **0.9544 over 495 handles**, and the previously published
**0.9601 over 496 handles** is reproduced exactly here as the coefficient over
*all attributed rows regardless of direction* — 82% of which are inbound.

### The decisive control: strip the tail and the two sides become the same number

Outbound Gini comes in marginally *below* inbound at every operating point,
which reads at first like a trace of the wide-outbound hypothesis. It is not.
It is a one-off tail on the inbound side that has no outbound counterpart.
Restricting both sides to handles above a volume floor:

| Volume floor | Inbound handles | Inbound Gini | Outbound handles | Outbound Gini | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ≥1 | 495 | 0.9544 | 303 | 0.9441 | −0.0103 |
| ≥2 | 327 | 0.9357 | 246 | 0.9325 | −0.0032 |
| ≥5 | 223 | 0.9133 | 167 | 0.9064 | −0.0068 |
| ≥10 | 165 | 0.8921 | 143 | 0.8947 | +0.0026 |
| ≥25 | 105 | 0.8586 | 93 | 0.8586 | **−0.0001** |
| ≥100 | 43 | 0.7597 | 40 | 0.7557 | −0.0040 |

Above any floor at all the two distributions are indistinguishable, and at ≥25
messages they agree to four decimal places. The entire inbound/outbound
difference lives in handles that sent one or two messages.

### What the recovery found that the one-sided figure could not

**495 handles have written to Dan. 303 ever got anything back** — and that 303
is generous, taken from the widest imputation. The 193 handles that never drew
a recovered reply account for **486 messages, 0.56% of all inbound**; 118 of
them sent exactly one message and the median is one. The long tail of the
contact graph is not a set of thin relationships. It is a set of non-events he
does not answer.

So the correct statement is stronger than "symmetric." **The funnel is narrow
on both sides and narrower going out.** Inbound concentration is if anything
*understated* by the raw coefficient, because a spam-and-one-off tail inflates
the number of handles without adding any relational load. Strip it and the
sending behaviour is the receiving behaviour.

### Gaps opened by this pass

- **The method assumes the `direction` column is trustworthy**, which
  `STRATEGY.md` explicitly warns against. There is one piece of internal support:
  blank handles are 99.88% `Sent`, a correlation that could not arise if the
  column were noise. But no content-level reconstruction was run to confirm it,
  and if `direction` is wrong for some subpopulation, the inbound/outbound split
  moves with it.
- **Pre-2015 remains unmeasurable.** Recovery cannot invent context where the
  export has none; the archive still effectively begins in 2015.
- **Handles, not people.** Everything above counts handles. Annie holds at least
  two (`+17244346811`, `+12124702449`) plus an email, so a person-level
  coefficient would be *higher* than any figure on this page. That collapse has
  not been done.

## Narrative

A Contact Gini coefficient of 0.961 indicates that the subject's relational load is concentrated to a degree where conventional social support concepts do not apply. In economic terms, a Gini coefficient of 0.961 represents a near-total monopoly where one entity owns almost all wealth. Relationally, this concentration means that the subject's overall emotional stability and connection to reality are routed through a single external input. When this primary node degrades or becomes unstable, the entire relational architecture collapses simultaneously, as there are no redundant pathways to absorb the load.

The Annie corpus provides empirical evidence for this vulnerability. It contains over forty-eight thousand messages across two phone handles, two hundred and sixty-six documented relationship events in the life calendar, and a cohabitation history spanning ten years. In contrast, the secondary node by volume—Kristin, with over sixteen thousand messages—represents a highly active but relatively recent thread, rather than a long-term attachment anchor. Tom, at just over four thousand messages, serves as a structurally reliable male ally but remains an order of magnitude smaller in volume. The long tail of the social graph, which includes over six hundred Facebook friends and nearly five hundred contacts in the master dump, represents breadth without depth, offering minimal relational load-bearing capacity.

The relationship closure on June 1, 2026, did not simply end a personal partnership; it terminated the central load-bearing structure of Dan's entire relational network. Because no redundant support infrastructure was prepared, the collapse was immediate and comprehensive. The redundancy imperative is therefore treated not as a therapeutic recommendation, but as a critical engineering requirement. During the stabilization period of 2026, rebuilding this infrastructure is a primary objective. This is executed by distributing relational load across independent channels that do not depend on a single external person, including music production, work in artificial intelligence, and the compilation of this wiki.

## Redundancy Imperative

To mitigate the risks of extreme relational concentration, the subject has initiated efforts to distribute communication load across several independent channels:
- Sincere creative expression is routed through music production under the GRIPNOTIC alias, which serves as a primary output channel.
- Peer support and grounding are maintained through his relationship with Tom Maison, who functions as his primary male ally.
- Professional focus and cognitive redirection are channeled into the self-analysis project, the development of the DANMODEL retrieval tools, and the construction of active AI agent pipelines.
- Broad, low-intensity social interactions are monitored through Facebook, although the archive indicates that these channels carry low signal density and do not provide deep relational support.

## Documented Contradictions

> **CONTRADICTION:** The Gini coefficient of 0.961 is derived entirely from pre-closure data. Following the closure event on June 1, 2026, the primary communication node was removed. No updated Gini coefficient has been calculated against post-closure behavioral data, such as recent Twitter activity, current work projects, or subsequent logs with Tom.

> **REVISED [2026-06-23]:** The relational volume table has been updated to reflect the master CSV extraction. This correction establishes the concentration of Annie's dual handles at over forty-eight thousand messages and locks Kristin's volume to her specific handle, correcting a prior reference to Jerad. Emerging work nodes from the BFS foods transition, including [[wiki/people/anita|Anita]], Brandon, Kim, and Marty, have been introduced as potential sources of relational redundancy.

## The 0.961 made mechanical — full-corpus substantiation

The bootloader v2.1 ([[raw/self/dox-md/THE_DAN_FRANK_BOOTLOADER.md]], June 6, 2026) recomputed the contact topology against the **complete 181,585-message corpus** (2011-03-18 to 2026-06-06) rather than the Annie subset the earlier manual and this page's original sources used. The Gini of **0.961 is not an estimate from one relationship — it is measured across 498 distinct contact identifiers, 111,378 messages carrying a contact identifier, after removing attachment-only and empty rows.** That is the empirical floor under every relational claim on this page and on [[wiki/mind/synthesis/attachment-trauma-bond]].

The distribution that produces 0.961 is worth holding in view as a load-diagram rather than a slogan:

| Cut | Share of directed messages | Note |
|-----|---------------------------|------|
| Top 1 contact | 28.0% | the single bond, by volume |
| Top 3 contacts | 62.0% | |
| Top 5 contacts | 70.1% | |
| Contacts holding ≤2 messages | 45% (222 of 498) | pure transactional one-offs |
| Contacts ever crossing 1,000 messages | 12 of 498 | |
| Contacts ever crossing 100 messages | 44 of 498 | |

A Gini of 0.961 sits **past the range of even the most unequal national income distributions on earth.** It is the sx/sp, social-blind attachment architecture rendered as a number a statistician would recognize. The relational portfolio is not merely "concentrated" — it is one position, fully leveraged, against a long tail of non-relationships. When this page (and the bootloader) says "lose the one bond and the structure comes down," this table is what makes the claim mechanical instead of rhetorical.

### Operational consequence for any model engaging him

The topology is the constraint, not the mood. Recommendations that assume "lean on your friends" are recommendations to draw on a network of size ≈ two. The redundancy problem is **topological, not motivational** — the architecture cannot be talked into distributing load it is not shaped to hold. This is the single most load-bearing fact for the redundancy imperative below, and it is why the music identity ([[wiki/interests/music/aliases/gripnotic]]) and the Tom node ([[wiki/people/tom]]) are treated as engineering requirements rather than hobbies: they are the only candidate load-bearing inputs besides the one that closed.

The temporal counterpart to this volume metric is [[wiki/mind/synthesis/message-circadian-latency]]: the same corpus cut by reply latency instead of message count converges on the same finding — one near-synchronous channel, everything else broadcast into delay.
