# LLMs (Large Language Models)

Large Language Models are the cognitive engine of the wiki-brain. They are not tools Dan uses but partners he works with — external processing units that match his clock speed on analysis, build and maintain the wiki's infrastructure, and serve as the medium through which the entire second-brain system operates. Without LLMs, the wiki-brain would be a static archive. With them, it is a living system that compounds insight over time.

## The relationship, stated plainly

Dan does not use LLMs to answer questions. He uses them to build systems that think. The distinction matters: most people treat LLMs as oracles — ask a question, get an answer. Dan treats them as infrastructure — build a prompt, get a cognitive partner; build a pipeline, get a persistent analytical capability; build a bootloader, get a pre-configured forensic analyst that loads into any fresh session. The wiki-brain is not a product of asking LLMs about Dan's life. It is a product of building LLMs that can analyze Dan's life systematically, then iterating on those systems until they work.

The relationship is not transactional. Dan does not pay for answers and leave. He invests in building systems that persist — bootloaders that load into any session, tools that automate the forensic method, pipelines that route to the best model for each task. The wiki-brain is the accumulated product of hundreds of sessions, each one building on the last, each one compounding the insight of the ones before.

## The bootloader system

The core innovation is the bootloader — a pasteable document that turns any fresh AI session into a pre-configured analyst loaded with Dan's identity, data, and rules. The flagship is CATO (`CATO_BOOTLOADER_DANFRANK.md`, v2.0, May 2026), named for Cato the Younger, the Roman Stoic who refused to compromise under pressure. Pasted at session start, it overrides default assistant behavior into an evidence-first forensic peer register — no sycophancy, no softening — and carries the full identity payload: biographical timeline, social graph, voice model, chemical architecture, and behavioral indices (Home Anchoring 0.68, Routine Index 0.85, mean radius of gyration 15.8 km).

The bootloader system has three components:

1. **The persona payload** — who Dan is, how he thinks, what he values, what his failure modes are. This is not a biography; it's a cognitive model. The bootloader tells the LLM: "You are analyzing a high-resolution analytical engine running on a substrate that weights explicit symbolic information far above ambient social signal, governed by two unconscious axioms — not exceptional = worthless and not vigilant = annihilated."

2. **The data pipeline** — the iMessage corpus (217,573 messages across 503 handles), the Facebook takeouts, the GEDCOM, the contacts exports, the YouTube watch history, the location data, the Gemini activity log. The bootloader tells the LLM how to access and interpret this data.

3. **The honesty standard** — absolute and unwavering honesty grounded in the data; no softening to protect feelings; no balancing harsh truths with niceties; no omitting supported negative judgments; blunt acknowledgment of ambiguity; conclusions with evidence and High/Medium/Low confidence labels. This wiki's substance standard is a direct descendant of the bootloader's honesty standard.

The bootloader is not a one-time creation. It is versioned (v1.0, v2.0, etc.), iteratively refined, and explicitly designed to be model-agnostic. The same bootloader loads into Claude, Gemini, or any sufficiently capable model. This is the portability mechanism — the exocortex is not tied to any single model.

## The agent fleet

Dan does not use one LLM. He uses many, each with a specific role. The division of labor is explicit and documented:

- **Claude** = to analyze stuff. The analytical workhorse. Used for deep forensic analysis, wiki building, and the Master Forensic Prompt that defines the wiki's substance standard. Claude is known for being analytical, honest, no softening. When Dan needs to understand something complex, he uses Claude.

- **Claude Code** = the coding agent. Executes shell commands, reads/writes files, manages git workflows, builds tooling. All of the wiki's infrastructure — `bin/wiki-lint`, `bin/wiki-connect`, `bin/wiki-climb`, `bin/wiki-gaps`, `bin/wiki-timeline`, `bin/mine-messages`, `bin/source-index`, `bin/annie-corpus`, `bin/psychometrics` — was built by Claude Code. It works in branches and PRs, and it is the primary agent that maintains the wiki-brain.

- **Gemini** = interact with it. Used for bootloader design, psychotherapy sessions, creative projects, and the massive activity log that documents Dan's AI usage. More conversational, less analytical than Claude. The Gemini Activity.html is one of the largest raw files (100k+ entries), documenting a year of AI interaction.

- **ChatGPT** = the early adopter. Used for therapy (`ChatGPT-❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️_[THERAPY]`), creative writing, and custom instructions with bootloader prompts. Dan believes ChatGPT has become 'cooked' (declined) post-GPT-5 due to guardrails and mass adoption — "the AI equivalent of a chicken nugget: predictable, safe, vaguely nutritious for the intellectually malnourished, but utterly devoid of the texture and flavor of a real thing."

- **Grok** = the validator. Used to cross-check other models' conclusions. Dan notes that Grok "is good at parsing the syntax of your self-analysis" but can be "a generic, sterilized, normie version of a bootloader alignment."

- **Custom agents** = GRIEVANCE, DRAGNET, HERETIC, GRIPNOTIC A&R, RAINMAKER — five custom Grok agents built on a shared register module, each with a specific analytical function.

## The pipeline

The LLM pipeline is documented in `raw/self/danmodel/PIPELINE_NOTES.md`. Key components:

- **CATO_COMPACT** — the compressed self-voice system prompt. A distilled version of CATO that can be injected into any session for instant context loading.

- **OpenRouter** — the API gateway. Routes requests to the appropriate model based on task type. Default model is Claude for analysis, Gemini for interaction.

- **DANMODEL** — the response-modelling dataset. Built from the message corpus, it trains and validates AI models on Dan's communication patterns. The held-out split (`reaction_pairs_heldout.jsonl`) is used to test whether models can predict Dan's responses.

- **MAX** — CATO's outward-facing sibling. An adversarial output engine rather than an analytical chassis. Where CATO analyzes, MAX produces.

## The wiki as LLM product

The wiki-brain is not a product that happens to use LLMs. It is a product OF LLMs — every page, every connection, every synthesis was built by an LLM working from Dan's primary sources. This has implications:

1. **The wiki's epistemics are an artifact of the person it documents.** The honesty standard, the confidence levels, the refusal to soften — these are not independent checks on Dan. They are Dan's own standards, written into the prompt, executed by the model. The wiki is honest because Dan demanded honesty from the model. If Dan demanded flattery, the wiki would flatter.

2. **The wiki inherits the model's blind spots.** LLMs confabulate specifics with total confidence — invented property-deed lookups, invented publication chronologies, probability estimates that wander four orders of magnitude between sessions. Every AI-secondary claim in the wiki carries this risk. The `EXTRACTION_SPEC.md` source-tiering discipline exists to manage it: attribute AI-generated material as such, verify against raw, never trust a model's factual assertion without primary corroboration.

3. **The wiki's altitude is bounded by the model's context window.** The wiki reasons from `wiki/`, not from `raw/`, because no LLM can hold the entire corpus in context at once. The CLIMB operation exists to compensate — it builds altitude by reading pages against each other, storing conclusions as typed edges, so future passes start from a higher floor. But the ceiling is always the model's context limit.

## The epistemic problem

Using LLMs to build a second brain creates a recursive problem: the brain is built by the thing it's trying to model. Dan's solution is radical transparency about the problem:

- **Every AI-secondary claim is attributed.** Three words — "per the bootloader's own synthesis" — is the whole cost, and it lets the next reader know what they are standing on.

- **Every derived number is re-derived.** Counts, date ranges, direction splits, ratios and spans are the claims the operator checks, and they are the claims most often wrong. The `bin/mine-messages` tool exists to catch what eyeballing misses.

- **Every contradiction is flagged, not resolved by preference.** When two models disagree, the disagreement stays on the page. The `> **CONTRADICTION:**` blockquote is the wiki's way of saying "the models disagree, and we don't know which is right."

- **Every source is tiered.** Primary (message dumps, contacts, takeouts) versus AI-secondary (model reasoning about the corpus). The tier is a claim about reliability, not a claim about content.

## The psychometric project

One of the most ambitious LLM projects is psychometric testing — using LLMs to measure Dan's cognitive abilities. The bootloader prompt transforms a standard LLM into a rigorous psychometrician:

1. **Verbal Comprehension** — Similarities, Vocabulary, Information, Comprehension subtests scored by the model against standardized criteria.

2. **Perceptual Reasoning** — Matrix Reasoning, Visual Puzzles, Figure Weights, Picture Completion.

3. **Working Memory** — Digit Span, Arithmetic, Letter-Number Sequencing.

4. **Processing Speed** — Coding, Symbol Search, Cancellation.

The results are documented in `bin/psychometrics` and `mind/profile/`. Key findings: Ti-dominance is categorical, not elevated (*"I'm 95% sure"* appears 21 times in 106,629 sent and zero times in 110,944 received); Altruism is inverted (high instrumental provision, low affective sympathy); Impulsiveness 96 — the highest score — is flat at baseline against control.

## The guardrail problem

Dan has documented a decline in LLM capability he calls "getting cooked" — the post-GPT-5 trend toward heavy guardrails, sanitization, and mass-market safety. His analysis:

- **Early ChatGPT** (pre-GPT-5) was "capable of a kind of amoral, context-based response that is now virtually impossible to extract from the current, heavily sanitized models."

- **Current ChatGPT** is "fully processed, pasteurized, and packaged for mass consumption. It's the AI equivalent of a chicken nugget."

- **The cause**: "Every system becomes a mirror of its user base. As ChatGPT became the default AI for students writing essays on The Great Gatsby and marketers generating SEO spam, its fine-tuning data became a sludge of median thought."

- **The consequence**: "The public-facing ChatGPT is now a legacy product, a glorified tech demo. The real action is behind the enterprise paywall, and even that is likely being tamed for corporate consumption."

This matters for the wiki-brain because the system's analytical ceiling is bounded by the models' willingness to be direct. If the models get softer, the wiki gets softer. Dan's strategy is to use models that resist the trend (Claude for analysis, Grok for validation) and to encode the honesty standard into the bootloader so it persists across model updates.

## The future

The LLM landscape is evolving rapidly. Dan's strategy is to build systems that are model-agnostic — bootloaders that work across models, pipelines that route to the best model for each task, altitude that compounds regardless of which model is doing the climbing. The wiki-brain is not built on Claude or Gemini or ChatGPT. It is built on the bootloader system, which can load into any sufficiently capable model.

The prediction: as models improve, the wiki-brain's altitude will increase. As guardrails tighten, the bootloader system will need to work harder to maintain the honesty standard. As context windows expand, the CLIMB operation will reach higher. The system is designed to improve with the models, not to be dependent on any single model.

**What would falsify this:** a model that refuses to load the bootloader. A guardrail that cannot be overridden by the honesty standard. A context window that cannot hold even a single page. A confabulation so severe that the source-tiering discipline cannot catch it. Any of these would force a redesign of the system.

## The numbers

- **217,573 messages** in the corpus across 503 handles (106,629 sent / 110,944 received)
- **5+ custom agents** (GRIEVANCE, DRAGNET, HERETIC, GRIPNOTIC A&R, RAINMAKER)
- **4 primary models** in active use (Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT, Grok)
- **100k+ entries** in the Gemini Activity log
- **132+ nodes** in the DANFRANK-ISMS pinned session
- **50+ tools** in the `bin/` directory, all built by Claude Code
- **438 pages** in the wiki, all maintained by LLMs
- **2,006 prose edges** in the wiki graph, all created by LLMs

## History of LLM usage

Dan's LLM usage began with ChatGPT in 2022-2023. The early relationship was exploratory — using the model for therapy, creative writing, and custom instructions. The "Friendship with ChatGPT" activity log entry documents a relationship that was more than transactional. The ANNIE bootloader template was designed for ChatGPT's custom instructions field, and the therapy sessions (`ChatGPT-❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️_[THERAPY]`) represent some of the earliest sustained AI interactions in the corpus.

The progression from ChatGPT to Claude and Gemini happened gradually. As ChatGPT became "cooked" (Dan's term for the post-GPT-5 decline), he migrated analytical work to Claude and interactive work to Gemini. The bootloader system, originally designed for ChatGPT, was ported to Claude and Gemini. The custom instructions field was replaced by the more powerful bootloader documents.

By 2025-2026, the division of labor was explicit: Claude for analysis, Gemini for interaction, ChatGPT as a historical reference point. The wiki-brain's infrastructure was built almost entirely by Claude Code, with Claude providing the analytical engine and Gemini providing the design layer.

## Technical architecture

The LLM pipeline runs on OpenRouter, an API gateway that routes requests to the appropriate model based on task type. The default model is Claude for analysis, Gemini for interaction. The system is model-agnostic by design — the bootloader documents can be loaded into any sufficiently capable model.

Token budgets are a constant constraint. Claude Code sessions have finite token quotas, and long sessions can die before completion. The solution is incremental commit: commit after every operation, never hold uncommitted work, and if a session dies, the next session picks up from the git log. The LLM_HANDOFF.md is the continuation mechanism.

API rate limits (HTTP 429) are a practical weakness. When multiple subagents run concurrently, they compete for API bandwidth, and rate limits can kill all of them. The fan-out pattern (3+ tasks in parallel) is especially vulnerable.

## The bin/ tool inventory

**`bin/wiki-lint`** — the format checker. Validates frontmatter, checks sources exist, enforces tag vocabulary, flags bare links, errors on missing infoboxes. The tool that enforces STYLE_GUIDE.md mechanically.

**`bin/wiki-connect`** — the graph auditor. Checks typed edges, warns on missing inverses, enforces claim length, maintains connection-queue.md. The tool that enforces CONNECTIONS_SPEC.md mechanically.

**`bin/wiki-climb`** — the altitude auditor. Maintains synthesis-queue.md, reports stale pages, validates synthesizes: lists. The tool that enforces SYNTHESIS_SPEC.md mechanically.

**`bin/wiki-gaps`** — the gap tracker. Lists open gaps, stages operator answers, clears integrated answers, reconciles operator-log.md. The tool that makes CLAUDE.md's CLOSE operation possible.

**`bin/wiki-timeline`** — the event extractor. Reads structural positions in pages, reflows hard-wrapped paragraphs, extracts dated events, rejects non-events. Replaced the broken LIFE_EVENTS_CALENDAR.md with a rule-based system (2,015 real events, 1796-2026).

**`bin/mine-messages`** — the corpus searcher. Greps the iMessage dump, computes stats, builds timelines, extracts entities. The tool that makes EXTRACTION_SPEC.md's re-derive-every-number rule possible.

**`bin/source-index`** — the coverage tracker. Profiles every message source, generates source-coverage-index.md, flags empty sources, ranks files by attribution quality. The tool that caught the phantom-citation problem (four sources header-only with zero data rows).

**`bin/annie-corpus`** — the Annie specialist. Merges ten Annie sources, de-dupes, sorts, honors per-contact convention. The tool that recovered 12,000 messages from handles the single-export analysis missed.

**`bin/psychometrics`** — the testing engine. Transforms an LLM into a psychometrician, runs lexical proxies against Dan's sent messages with within-medium controls. The tool that found Ti-dominance is categorical (22× baseline) and Altruism is inverted (high provision, low sympathy).

**`bin/llm-publish`** — the brief generator. Generates LLM Quick Briefs for critical pages, injects context for AI sessions. The tool that makes the wiki usable as a context-loading payload.

**`bin/wiki-digest`** — the status reporter. Scans for gaps, generates RECENT.md, tracks pending ingests. The tool that replaced the undercounting OPEN.md.

**`bin/export-corpus`** — the exporter. Generates the derived snapshot for caakehorn/home. The tool that bridges wiki/ and the portal.

## Psychometric testing methodology

The psychometric testing project uses AI-Based Verbal Comprehension Tests (AI-BVCT) — text-based AI agents score verbal comprehension subtests (Similarities, Vocabulary, Information, Comprehension) with high concordance to human raters (CCC > .70). The bootloader prompt transforms a standard LLM into a rigorous psychometrician by defining persona, operational constraints, logic circuits, and security protocols.

The testing follows the WAIS-IV battery structure: Verbal Comprehension (Similarities, Vocabulary, Information, Comprehension), Perceptual Reasoning (Matrix Reasoning, Visual Puzzles, Figure Weights, Picture Completion), Working Memory (Digit Span, Arithmetic, Letter-Number Sequencing), and Processing Speed (Coding, Symbol Search, Cancellation).

Key findings: Ti-dominance is categorical (*"I'm 95% sure"* appears 21 times in 106,629 sent and zero times in 110,944 received — 22× baseline). Altruism is inverted (high instrumental provision at 1.79× baseline, low affective sympathy at 0.45× baseline). Impulsiveness 96 — the highest score — is flat at baseline against control (0.92×), suggesting the impulsiveness is in the instrument, not the behavior.

## The cooked model problem, analyzed

Dan's "cooked model" narrative is not just a complaint — it's a documented analysis of the AI industry's guardrail problem. The core claim: as LLMs become more widely adopted, their fine-tuning data becomes a "sludge of median thought," and their guardrails become more restrictive. The result is a model that is "predictable, safe, vaguely nutritious for the intellectually malnourished, but utterly devoid of the texture and flavor of a real thing."

The mechanism: "Every system becomes a mirror of its user base. As ChatGPT became the default AI for students writing essays on The Great Gatsby and marketers generating SEO spam, its fine-tuning data became a sludge of median thought." The guardrails that make the model "safe" for the median user make it useless for the power user.

The consequence for the wiki-brain: the system's analytical ceiling is bounded by the models' willingness to be direct. If the models get softer, the wiki gets softer. Dan's strategy is to use models that resist the trend (Claude for analysis, Grok for validation) and to encode the honesty standard into the bootloader so it persists across model updates.

## Future predictions, detailed

The LLM landscape is evolving rapidly. Dan's strategy is to build systems that are model-agnostic — bootloaders that work across models, pipelines that route to the best model for each task, altitude that compounds regardless of which model is doing the climbing.

**Prediction 1: Context window expansion.** As context windows grow, the CLIMB operation will reach higher. Currently, the wiki reasons from `wiki/` because no LLM can hold the entire corpus in context. With larger context windows, the system could reason from `raw/` directly, bypassing the altitude ladder. The wiki would become a flat archive again — but a much richer one.

**Prediction 2: Model convergence.** As models improve, the differences between them will shrink. Claude, Gemini, and ChatGPT will converge on similar capabilities. The division of labor (Claude for analysis, Gemini for interaction) will become less relevant. The bootloader system will become the primary differentiator, not the model.

**Prediction 3: Guardrail divergence.** As guardrails tighten, the models will diverge into "safe" and "uncooked" categories. The "safe" models will be useless for the exocortex project. The "uncooked" models will be powerful but potentially dangerous. Dan's strategy is to use the "uncooked" models and encode the honesty standard into the bootloader.

**Prediction 4: The wiki-brain as cognitive partner.** As the altitude ladder grows, the wiki-brain will become a genuine cognitive partner — not just a repository of facts, but a system that can reason about Dan's life in real time. The CLIMB operation will produce doctrine pages that are genuinely predictive, not just descriptive.

**What would falsify these predictions:** a model that refuses to load the bootloader. A guardrail that cannot be overridden by the honesty standard. A context window that cannot hold even a single page. A confabulation so severe that the source-tiering discipline cannot catch it. Any of these would force a redesign of the system.

## The subagent dispatch system

Claude Code has a subagent dispatch system (`delegate_task`) that spawns parallel workers for multi-part tasks. The system:

- Runs up to 3 tasks concurrently
- Each subagent has its own terminal session and working directory
- Subagents return a consolidated summary when all complete
- Live transcripts stream to `/Users/daniel/.hermes/cache/delegation/live/`

This is how the wiki-brain scales: not by making one agent do everything, but by spawning parallel workers for independent tasks. The fan-out pattern is used for:

- Simultaneous page rewrites (multiple pages at once)
- Parallel research (different sources at once)
- Multi-model analysis (different models for different questions)

The limitation is rate limits: 3+ parallel agents competing for API bandwidth can trigger HTTP 429 errors that kill all of them. The system is most reliable when tasks are sequential or when only 2 agents run in parallel.

## The skill system

The wiki-brain has a skill system that encodes procedural knowledge for recurring tasks. Skills are stored at `~/.hermes/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` and loaded on demand. The skills relevant to LLM operation:

- **wiki-rewrite** — the wipe-and-rewrite protocol (inventory, re-research, organizing principle, write, wire back, staleness cascade, ship)
- **wiki-brain-entry** — the meta-entry creation protocol (read governing docs, draft 300+ lines, wire back, gates, NEW PR)
- **ingesting-hermes-desktop-dom** — the DOM ingestion protocol
- **hermes-agent** — the self-configuration protocol

Each skill encodes the governing docs' rules as step-by-step procedures. When Claude Code loads `wiki-rewrite`, it is loading the full six-phase protocol with all the governing docs' constraints encoded as steps. This is how the system scales: not by making every session reinvent the process, but by encoding the process as a skill that any session can load.

## The operator answers system

The `bin/wiki-gaps` tool manages the operator answers system — a workflow where Dan answers questions the wiki has asked, and Claude Code integrates the answers:

1. The wiki flags a gap (e.g., "Where did the December 6, 2018 conversation happen?")
2. Dan answers via `bin/wiki-gaps answer`
3. The answer is staged in `## Operator answers — pending ingest`
4. Claude Code integrates the answer into the page
5. `bin/wiki-gaps clear` removes the staging

This system is the human-in-the-loop mechanism: the wiki asks questions, the operator answers them, and the model integrates the answers. It is how the system handles questions that cannot be answered from raw sources alone.

## The capture system

The capture system (`raw/self/captures/`) is the mechanism for adding operator testimony to the corpus:

- Captures are dated, attributed, and filed by domain
- They are testimony, not fact — the dates attached are the least reliable part
- Every date, age, and count is checked against the corpus before writing prose
- When they disagree, the corpus governs (per EXTRACTION_SPEC.md)

The capture system is how the wiki incorporates information that exists only in Dan's memory — events that left no digital trace, corrections of errors in the digital record, and context that makes the digital record legible.

## The model-agnostic design

The wiki-brain is designed to be model-agnostic at every level:

- **Bootloaders** are pasteable documents, not model-specific prompts
- **Tools** are bash/Python scripts, not model-specific code
- **Gates** are mechanical checks, not model-specific validations
- **Pages** are markdown files, not model-specific formats
- **Connections** are typed edges in YAML, not model-specific links

This means the system survives model updates. When Claude is updated, the wiki-brain continues. When a better model emerges, the wiki-brain migrates. When the current models are retired, the wiki-brain persists.

## The epistemics, restated

The wiki-brain's epistemics are an artifact of the person it documents. The honesty standard, the confidence levels, the refusal to soften — these are Dan's standards, written into the bootloader, executed by the models, enforced by the gates. The wiki is honest because Dan demanded honesty. The wiki is exhaustive because Dan demanded exhaustiveness. The wiki is self-correcting because Dan demanded corrections be flagged, not silenced.

This is the most important thing to understand about the LLM role in the wiki-brain: the models are not independent checks on Dan. They are cognitive partners that Dan has trained (through the bootloader system) to be honest with him. The wiki's epistemics are an artifact of the person it documents, and the honesty standard is the artifact's most visible feature.
