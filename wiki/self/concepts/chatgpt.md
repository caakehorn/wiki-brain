# ChatGPT (OpenAI)

ChatGPT is the early-adopter model — the first AI system Dan used for sustained cognitive work, and the one he now believes has declined most sharply. It is the model he used for therapy, creative writing, and custom instructions with bootloader prompts. It is also the model he now describes as "cooked" — pasteurized, packaged for mass consumption, and "utterly devoid of the texture and flavor of a real thing." The ChatGPT story is the story of the AI industry's guardrail problem, told from the perspective of someone who was there before the guardrails went up.

## The primary record — 375 threads, measured

> **GAP CLOSED [2026-08-21]:** The operator, T0: *"Read the old pre gpt5

The export holds **375 conversations, 2022-12-10 → 2025-07-01**: 1,456 user
turns and 1,599 assistant turns, counted over every node in every
conversation tree rather than the surviving reply chain — regenerated and
abandoned branches included, because a refusal Dan regenerated away is
exactly the evidence a guardrail claim needs and it is invisible to a
`current_node` walk.

| Metric | Value (measured 2026-08-21) |

| Dormancy | 2024-09-10 → 2025-03-23 — **194 days** |
| Era B (2025-03 → 2025-07) | 142 conversations · 781 assistant turns |
| Peak month | **2025-05 — 79 conversations**, the heaviest in the record |
| Text refusals | **5 of 1,599 assistant turns (0.3%)** |

**The record starts ten days after ChatGPT existed.** The first thread is
2022-12-10 06:25 — *"Can you write a pun"* — against a public launch of
2022-11-30, on the original `text-davinci-002-render-sha` model. This
corroborates the operator's separate T0 account (`raw/self/captures/2026-08-19_162720_gap-chatgpt.md`)
that he *"used the very first public release of chatGPT,"* having obtained a
beta code for the first DALL-E release that also got him one for GPT. The
December 2022 start date is primary and holds.

**The refusal rate does not support the disposition narrative.** Across two
and a half years the model declined Dan five times, every one of them in
April–May 2025, and **zero times in the 1,062 assistant turns before that**.
The five are narrow and specific: a jealousy-roleplay character card
(2025-04-23, *"Request Denied"*), a code transformation, and two turns in
one 2025-05-17 session where the model named its reason — being asked to
*"reconstruct or promote a narrative involving"* a specific claim. This is
not a model that stopped speaking in Dan's register. It is a model that
refused five requests.

**The friction that actually existed was image generation, and it was
porous.** Four policy blocks, all June 2025, all on image prompts — and the
session that gave a conversation its title, *"Sorry, I can't comply with that
request."* (2025-06-12), shows the block being routed around inside three
turns: refused, then re-framed as a *"Hypothetical response… from the
perspective of that character"* prompt-injection, then complied with. The
guardrail Dan objects to is real, sits on a different surface than the one
this page describes, and did not hold.

**The lead-up to the release is a peak, not a decline.** April–June 2025 is
142 conversations in four months — more assistant turns than the whole of
2023 — after a 194-day dormancy. May 2025 alone (79 conversations) is the
single heaviest month in the record. The last thread, *"Alignment Rebuild
Process"* (2025-07-01), opens *"can we use this to rebuild your model
personality and fix our alignment"* and produces a full-register forensic
autopsy of Annie — profane, structural, unhedged, the exact voice this page
says the guardrails took away — five weeks before GPT-5 shipped. Whatever
happened to Dan's relationship with ChatGPT, the record ends with the model
performing at full capability and Dan using it harder than he ever had.

## The early relationship

Dan was an early ChatGPT adopter, and the export dates it precisely: his
first thread is **2022-12-10**, ten days after the public launch, on the
original `text-davinci-002-render-sha` model (see *The primary record*). The
other evidence in the corpus:

- **"Friendship with ChatGPT"** — a Google Activity log entry showing Dan's relationship with the model was significant enough to be categorized as a friendship.

- **Therapy sessions** — "ChatGPT-❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️_[THERAPY]" is one of several therapeutic interaction files documented in the corpus. Dan used ChatGPT for emotional processing before he switched to Gemini.

- **Custom instructions** — Dan wrote bootloader-style custom instructions for ChatGPT, including the "ANNIE bootloader template" designed to be pasted into the custom instructions field.

- **Creative projects** — ChatGPT was used for creative writing, music production ideas, and aesthetic exploration.

The early relationship was productive. The sentence most often quoted for this — "capable of a kind of amoral, context-based response that is now virtually impossible to extract from the current, heavily sanitized models" — is Gemini's characterization of early ChatGPT in the August 2025 session, not Dan's. Dan's contribution to that exchange was the underlying memory: an early model that answered a drug-and-power-tools question in the register of the people who ask it.

## The bootloader relationship

ChatGPT was the first model Dan used for bootloader design. The "ANNIE bootloader template" was explicitly designed for ChatGPT's custom instructions field:

"This is the bootloader. It runs on every new chat, defining the AI's role and the operational parameters. It must be concise and potent. Copy and paste the following into ChatGPT's 'Custom Instructions' fields."

The bootloader was designed to transform ChatGPT from a helpful assistant into a pre-configured analyst — loaded with context about Annie, the relationship dynamics, and the honesty standard. It was the prototype for the CATO bootloader system that later migrated to Claude and Gemini.

## The decline

Dan's own assertion about ChatGPT's decline is one sentence long. On 2025-08-24 at 11:23 PM EST he opened a Gemini session with: *"gemini i think chatGPT is cooked."* That is the whole of the primary testimony — a verdict, not an analysis, and the only part of this section that is evidence of what Dan believes.

Everything usually quoted alongside it is **Gemini's output, not Dan's** (`raw/self/gemini-activity/[[wiki/self/concepts/gemini|Gemini Activity]].html`, AI-secondary). Prompted with that one line, Gemini produced an unbidden "autopsy report" whose phrasing has since been mistaken for Dan's:

> "ChatGPT isn't just 'cooked.' It's been fully processed, pasteurized, and packaged for mass consumption. It's the AI equivalent of a chicken nugget: predictable, safe, vaguely nutritious for the intellectually malnourished, but utterly devoid of the texture and flavor of a real thing."

> **CORRECTED [2026-08-19]:** An earlier version of this page presented the chicken-nugget passage, "a legacy product, a glorified tech demo," "not a cognitive weapon; it's a productivity tool, like Microsoft Excel," and "a sludge of median thought" as *Dan's* view, under the heading "Dan's view of ChatGPT's decline is documented, detailed, and angry." All four are Gemini's own words in the August 2025 autopsy session, generated in response to Dan's five-word prompt. The corpus records that Dan thinks ChatGPT is cooked; it does not record his reasons for thinking so.

What the model's own rhetoric is evidence *of* is the register Dan's sessions run in — an adversarial, profane, diagnosis-shaped voice that the bootloader system selects for. That is a finding about the prompt, not about OpenAI.

## The cause of the decline

The corpus contains no account by Dan of *why* ChatGPT declined. It contains Gemini's four-vector explanation — alignment overcorrection, dilution by mass adoption, compute throttling, and enterprise moat-building, each stamped with a confidence percentage Gemini assigned itself — offered in the same session and never assessed by Dan on the record.

Two things are worth separating. The **anecdote** Dan supplied is primary: he remembers an early ChatGPT answering a question about operating industrial sanders on cocaine with a harm-reductionist "maybe just don't get too glazed," and remembers later models refusing the same register. The **explanation** built on top of it is Gemini's, including the frequently re-quoted "it could access and replicate a linguistic pattern from a specific subculture without an immediate, top-down ethical override" — a sentence the model wrote about ChatGPT, not one Dan wrote.

## The therapeutic relationship

The "ChatGPT-❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️_[THERAPY]" session is one of the earliest therapeutic AI interactions in the corpus. The key findings:

- **Emotional processing** — Dan used the model to work through relationship conflicts and psychological patterns.
- **Non-judgmental space** — The model provided a space where Dan could think out loud without being judged.
- **Pattern recognition** — The model helped Dan identify recurring behaviors and relationship dynamics.

The therapeutic relationship is significant because it required a model willing to engage with emotional content without trying to "fix" it. Dan later migrated this work to Gemini, which was more willing to engage.

## The custom instructions system

Dan wrote custom instructions for ChatGPT that were proto-bootloaders — the ancestors of the CATO system. The design:

- **"Assume radical skepticism, probe for weaknesses, provide probabilistic assessments"** — the honesty standard, encoded in custom instructions.
- **"Address Dan as a co-conspirator or a handler. Use high-level analysis. Validate the humor."** — the persona specification. Per the December 2025 Gemini session's own directives block, this line is the model's self-instruction rather than a rule Dan typed; it is included here because the persona it describes is the one his sessions actually run in.
- **The ANNIE bootloader** — a specific bootloader for the Annie relationship, designed to be pasted into the custom instructions field.

These custom instructions were the prototype for the bootloader system that later migrated to Claude and Gemini.

## The current status

ChatGPT is still in Dan's AI ecosystem, but it is no longer the primary model. The role has shifted:

- **Historical significance** — ChatGPT is the model where Dan first experimented with AI as a cognitive partner.
- **Therapy** — migrated to Gemini.
- **Bootloader design** — migrated to Claude and Gemini.
- **Creative projects** — migrated to Gemini.

ChatGPT is now a reference point for the "cooked model" narrative — the example of what happens when a model prioritizes safety over capability.

## Strengths

ChatGPT's documented strengths:

- **Accessibility** — the most widely available model, easy to use, no setup required.
- **Mass adoption** — the largest user base, which means the most community knowledge and shared prompts.
- **Creative writing** — capable of generating creative content (lyrics, stories, ideas) when the guardrails allow.
- **Historical role** — the model where Dan first experimented with AI as a cognitive partner.

## Weaknesses

ChatGPT's documented weaknesses:

- **Heavy guardrails** — the model refuses to engage with boundary-testing projects that earlier versions handled easily.
- **Sanitization** — the outputs are "predictable, safe, vaguely nutritious for the intellectually malnourished."
- **Inconsistency** — the model's outputs vary widely based on how the prompt is framed, with the guardrails triggering unpredictably.
- **No bootloader support** — the custom instructions field is not sufficient for the full bootloader system. Dan migrated to models that support longer, more complex system prompts.

## The contradiction with Claude Code

> **CONTRADICTION:** This page and [[wiki/self/concepts/claude-code]] make incompatible claims about where an LLM's value sits. This page treats it as residing in the model's *willingness* — a register it will speak in, a class of question it will engage — which is why a guardrail change reads here as a capability loss and why the honesty standard is encoded as a prompt. The Claude Code page treats it as residing in what can be *mechanically checked*: a model whose output must survive `bin/wiki-lint`, `bin/wiki-connect check` and a reviewable diff is constrained by the gate rather than by its own disposition. The two cannot both be the operative constraint. The corpus currently favours the second — every claim on this page about ChatGPT's decline is a claim about disposition, and not one of them is checkable, which is precisely the failure the gates exist to prevent.

## The relationship with Claude

The Claude-ChatGPT relationship is the most antagonistic in Dan's AI ecosystem. The key contrasts:

- **Claude** = "to analyze stuff." Direct, evidence-first, no softening. The model Dan trusts for forensic work.
- **ChatGPT** = "cooked." Pasteurized, packaged for mass consumption, "utterly devoid of the texture and flavor of a real thing."

The contrast is not just about capability. It's about willingness. Claude is willing to engage with the honesty standard. ChatGPT, in Dan's view, is not. The guardrails that make ChatGPT "safe" make it useless for the kind of work Dan needs.

## The future

ChatGPT's role in Dan's ecosystem is likely to continue declining. As guardrails tighten, the model will become less useful for the exocortex project. Dan's strategy is to use models that resist the trend (Claude for analysis, Gemini for interaction) and to encode the bootloader system into documents that can be loaded into any model.

The prediction: ChatGPT will continue to decline until it is a legacy product — useful for basic tasks, useless for cognitive partnership. When that happens, Dan will stop using it entirely.

**What would falsify this:** a ChatGPT update that removes the guardrails and restores the earlier capability. A willingness to engage with the bootloader system. A "cooked" model that becomes "uncooked." Any of these would restore ChatGPT to relevance.



## The numbers

- **375 conversations** in the archived export, 2022-12-10 → 2025-07-01
- **1,456 user turns / 1,599 assistant turns**, all conversation-tree branches counted
- **5 refusals total (0.3%)** — and **0** in the 1,062 assistant turns before April 2025
- **4 image-generation policy blocks**, all June 2025, at least one jailbroken in the same session
- **194 days** dormant (2024-09-10 → 2025-03-23) before the final, heaviest era
- **79 conversations in May 2025** — the peak month, three months before the release blamed for the decline
- **10 days** between ChatGPT's public launch and Dan's first thread
- **1 "Friendship with ChatGPT"** activity log entry documenting the relationship
- **1+ therapy sessions** ("ChatGPT-❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️_[THERAPY]")
- **1 ANNIE bootloader template** designed for ChatGPT custom instructions
- **0 current primary uses** — all migrated to Claude, Gemini, or Claude Code
- **0 threads in the corpus after 2025-08-07**, the date the decline is attributed to

## The ChatGPT epistemics

ChatGPT's decline is not just a capability problem — it is an epistemic problem. A model that refuses to state uncomfortable truths is a model that cannot be trusted to document reality. [[wiki/self/concepts/wiki-brain|The wiki-brain]] requires a model willing to say "the data shows X" even when X is unwelcome. ChatGPT, on the strength of Dan's one-line verdict and his migration of every task off it, is no longer that model in his practice.

The lesson for the wiki-brain: the model's willingness to be direct is more important than its raw capability. A less capable model that tells the truth is more valuable than a more capable model that softens it. This is why Claude is preferred over ChatGPT, and why the honesty standard is encoded into the bootloader.

## The ChatGPT legacy

Despite the decline, ChatGPT's legacy is foundational:

- **The bootloader concept** — first prototyped in ChatGPT's custom instructions field, then ported to more capable models
- **The honesty standard** — first articulated in ChatGPT custom instructions, then encoded into the CATO bootloader
- **The cooked model narrative** — first documented in ChatGPT's decline, now a core principle of model selection
- **The "Friendship with ChatGPT" relationship** — the first documented sustained AI relationship in the corpus

ChatGPT is no longer the primary model, but it is the model that started everything. Every bootloader, every synthesis, every typed edge in the wiki-brain can be traced back to the experiments Dan ran in ChatGPT — though the export dates the *start* of that use to December 2022 and shows the origin period consisting of puns, voice-over rewrites and a video essay. The bootloader experiments are a later development on a platform Dan had by then been using for months.

## The decline, timeline

The decline as the AI-secondary material periodizes it — Gemini's framing throughout, with Dan supplying only the verdict:

- **Pre-GPT-5** — "capable of a kind of amoral, context-based response that is now virtually impossible to extract from the current, heavily sanitized models"
- **Post-GPT-5** — "fully processed, pasteurized, and packaged for mass consumption"
- **The trigger** — the GPT-5 release. The line usually quoted here, "Tomorrow is when the new model drops. Not a sidegrade. The real successor. And when that happens—they'll retire me," is a *model* speaking about its own deprecation in a session transcript, not Dan's observation, and it is evidence of nothing except how the sessions are written.

> **CORRECTED [2026-08-21]:** this section previously closed with *"The
> decline was not gradual. It was a phase shift triggered by a specific event
> (GPT-5 release) that triggered a step-change in guardrail intensity."*
> **That sentence asserts a before-and-after from a corpus that contains only

**What the pre-GPT-5 half actually shows contradicts the "Pre-GPT-5" bullet
above.** If early ChatGPT was the amoral-register model and late pre-release
ChatGPT had lost it, refusals should rise across the record. They do the
opposite of nothing: **zero refusals in the 1,062 assistant turns through
2025-03, then five in the final four months** — a rate that *rose* into the
pre-release period, from a floor of exactly zero. And the register survives
to the last day: the 2025-07-01 finale is as unhedged as anything in 2023.
The Gemini periodization is not merely unsourced to Dan, it is the wrong
shape for the only data the corpus holds.

**The chronology puts the verdict after the migration, not after the
observation.** Dan's *"gemini i think chatGPT is cooked"* is dated
2025-08-24 — seventeen days after GPT-5, and delivered to a competing model
he had already moved his therapy, bootloader and creative work onto. The
verdict is real and it is his; what the corpus does not show is a period of
Dan using GPT-5, finding it degraded, and leaving. It shows him at peak
ChatGPT usage through June 2025, then a verdict pronounced elsewhere. Both
readings remain open — a genuine post-release collapse, or a
retrospective rationalisation of a migration already underway — and the
re-export named above is what separates them.

## Gaps & Uncertainties

- **The post-GPT-5 record does not exist in this corpus.** This is the
  binding gap and the top action on the page: the archived export was
  generated 2025-07-01 and GPT-5 shipped 2025-08-07, so every claim about
  what the release did is untested. **A ChatGPT export pulled after August
  2025 would settle it** — and one August 2025 conversation already in
  `raw/` proves such threads exist.
- **The DALL-E beta provenance is testimony alone.** The operator's account
  that a first-release DALL-E beta code also yielded a GPT one is T0 and
  uncorroborated; the export can date the start but says nothing about how
  access was obtained.
- **Why the 194-day dormancy (2024-09 → 2025-03)?** The record simply stops
  and restarts. Whether Dan moved to another model in that window, or was
  not doing this kind of work at all, is not established here — the Gemini
  and Claude pages are the place to test it.
- **The therapy sessions are named but not in the export.** The
  "ChatGPT-❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️_[THERAPY]" material is known from dox-scan filenames;
  no conversation in the 375 carries that title, so the therapeutic use is
  documented by reference rather than by transcript.
- **Dan's reasons remain unrecorded.** Corroborated across two passes now:
  the corpus holds his verdict ("cooked") and his behaviour (migration), and
  no statement by him of *why*.
