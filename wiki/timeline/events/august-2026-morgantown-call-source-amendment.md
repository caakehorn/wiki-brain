# Source Amendment — Morgantown St Recording, August 16 2026

> **SUPERSEDED [2026-08-20], same day.** This note recorded that a transcript
> had arrived. The work it called for has since been done: every quotation on
> [[wiki/timeline/events/august-2026-morgantown-call]] has been checked against
> the transcript, five figures were corrected, one flat assertion did not
> survive, and four findings the secondary transcript had missed were added.
> **Read the event page, not this note.** What remains here is provenance
> bookkeeping, duplicated in
> `raw/self/audio/README_2026-08-16_morgantown-call.md` and
> `raw/self/audio/2026-08-20_Morgantown_St-source-verification.md`.
>
> This page should probably be folded into the event page and deleted — it is
> a page about the wiki's own sourcing process, which STYLE_GUIDE rule 6
> forbids in page bodies and which has no inbound links. It is left in place

**Filed 2026-08-20.** This amendment exists because the original event page was written while the audio had not yet been directly transcribed in the corpus.

## New primary-source package

The operator has supplied the actual `Morgantown St.m4a` audio and a timestamped speaker-labelled transcript. The transcript is now filed verbatim beside the audio at `raw/self/audio/2026-08-16_Morgantown_St_call-transcript.txt`.

The supplied audio is 13,097,702 bytes, 927.242449 seconds, AAC stereo, and has MD5 `96bd3df46d4b0f4c5278cc9d6978621d` and SHA-256 `f656b6abd5c676a001eaf1f9a207cbc1fad262b3dbc3e9b145618d2bc307a4ec`. Its Voice Memos UUID is `5B51561B-0110-4FDD-98B8-B41DB654CFDD`.

The supplied transcript contains 611 lines and timestamped turns through `00:14:59`; the audio continues to `00:15:27.24`. It is preserved exactly as supplied.

## Correction to the event page's source status

The event page's statement that the recording was **"T0 primary — but unheard"** and that the transcript was **"NOT TRANSCRIBED"** is now obsolete. The page's substantive quotations should be treated as **directly checkable against the newly filed transcript and, where exact wording matters, against the audio itself**.

The older Hermes/PDF transcript remains a secondary comparison source. It should not outrank the newly supplied audio or its direct transcription.

## Important epistemic boundary

"Authenticated raw source material provided" here means **source material and file integrity have been established at the artifact level**: the actual audio was supplied, its metadata and hashes were inspected, and a concrete transcript was supplied and preserved.

It does **not** mean that an independent forensic examination has proved the recording unedited or that every transcript speaker attribution has been independently acoustically verified. Those are separate claims and should remain separate in downstream analysis.

## High-confidence source-supported observations now available for checking

The supplied transcript directly represents, among other things:

- Speaker 1 saying they went through her phone while she was sleeping (`00:00:43`).
- Speaker 2 repeatedly saying they want to leave and asking for their phone (`00:04:16`, `00:04:59`, `00:05:07`, `00:09:44`, `00:11:54`, `00:12:45`).
- Speaker 1 repeatedly conditioning return of the phone on answers to questions (`00:05:08`, `00:06:37`, `00:08:38`, etc.).
- Speaker 3 repeatedly telling Speaker 1 to return the phone and let Speaker 2 leave (`00:05:12`, `00:06:31`, `00:06:52`, `00:07:31`, `00:08:13`, `00:09:16` onward, and repeatedly through `00:14:17`).
- Speaker 2 explicitly saying, `"You threatened me"` at `00:05:22` and `"You're holding me hostage"` at `00:09:10` and `00:09:25`.
- Speaker 1 threatening to call parents and involving them in the dispute at multiple points.
- Speaker 1 telling Speaker 3, `"Gay ass, kill yourself"` at `00:08:12`.

These are **transcript-level observations**, not legal findings. Speaker identities should be carried as transcript labels unless independently resolved.

## Operational rule going forward

When a downstream wiki page says the recording is "unheard," "not transcribed," or "two removes from the audio," treat that language as stale and consult this amendment plus the new transcript. Do not rewrite the old AI analysis as though it were primary; instead, retain its provenance and explicitly distinguish its claims from the newly supplied source material.
