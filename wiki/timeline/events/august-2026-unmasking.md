## Spine

| Time (EDT) | Event |
|---|---|
| 2026-08-08 19:01:22 | **FOREWARN lookup executed.** The interloper is identified as Jerel Wayne Coles. Thirteen-day refusal terminated. See [[wiki/people/jerel-coles]]. |
| 19:38:34 | "hi you" — first contact |
| 19:44:18 | "Did he come?" — her first reply is about the dealer |
| 19:57:01 | "there's one reason you are interested in hearing from me" |
| 20:07:17 | "I gave you more than enough money" |
| 21:22:17 | "your big romantic Saturday night plans" — first inference of the third party from silence |
| 22:40:49 | "if you even maintained contact with the person trying to fuck my life up" — inference now asserted as fact |
| **23:09:20** | **"He'll?"** — almost certainly *Hell?* |
| **23:10:38** | **"HE'LL rape you again."** Read by her in **2 seconds** |
| 23:11:02 | ".stpp…" |
| 00:03:30 | TRO drafted aloud; "portfolio of more than a dozen threats he's made in writing" |
| 00:28:56 | "sleeping" — the claim enters the conversation |
| 00:30:43 | The eight-timestamp list |
| 00:32:25 | "keep the stupidest lies for **Jerel**" — the name enters the message record |
| 00:38:10 | "annie if I am being crazy I honestly want to know" — read in 0s |
| 00:43:29 | "Fucking drugs" — she names the subject |
| **02:01:59** | "I see you figured out that you had read receipts on" |
| **02:24:54** | **Last read receipt. Coverage ends.** |
| 02:25:52 | "I fell asleep" — 58 seconds later |
| 03:41:32 | "I seriously did fall asleep?" — **unanswered** |

## The sleep narrative

### The eight timestamps verify 8/8

Presented at 00:30:43 as the product of "the research." They are in fact her own
outbound message times, and every one matches:

```
8:07 → 20:07:02/:05/:17/:23     8:44 → 20:44:20      9:42 → 21:42:08
10:03 → 22:03:51, 22:05:10      10:15 → 22:16:16     11:09 → 23:09:20, 23:10:04
11:23 → 23:23:57                12:27 → 00:27:06
```

**But the claim they falsify was made two minutes *after* the list's window
closed.** At each of those eight moments she was sending one- and two-word
fragments — "Excuse me," "Dan," "Wait," "???" — none of which is a claim about
being asleep. The list proves wakefulness at eight points she never contested.

### The steelman, and its failure

The strongest innocent reading is that each sleep statement explains the gap she
had just emerged from. Tested directly:

| Claim | Time | Gap immediately preceding |
|---|---|---|
| "I was shedding..:" | 00:28:03 | 0.4 min |
| "sleeping" | 00:28:56 | 0.1 min |
| "I was asleep" | 00:40:12 | 0.1 min |
| "I fell asleep" | 02:25:52 | 1.0 min |
| "I seriously did fall asleep?" | 03:41:32 | **75.7 min** |

**Four of five fail.** They were authored mid-burst at zero-second read latency
— a phone in hand, thread live. The fifth follows a genuine three-quarter-hour
absence and is likely literally true.

### What survives as the finding

Not a lie about sleep. **A refusal to narrow.** A defensible 63-minute window
existed in the record (23:23:57 → 00:26:49) and was never invoked, across three
explicit invitations including a sincere one. The structure is refusal to
concede any ground at all, maintained past the point where partial concession
would have been cheaper and more credible than total denial.

**Base rate:** [[wiki/mind/concepts/node-locking]] locks *blackout patterns
post-confront* into the Signals node; [[wiki/mind/concepts/forensic-method]] models
the January 2026 ten-day blackout as a Grim Trigger. Going dark after
confrontation is a **catalogued signature with prior instances**, not a novel
event.

**Undetermined, and left undetermined:** whether receipts were toggled off at
~02:25 or the thread simply was not opened. The `reply_to_guid` argument that
would have settled this is void — see [[wiki/mind/synthesis/read-receipt-forensics]]
finding M2.

## The misparse

```
23:08:54  DAN  "Hey when you're sitting in jail or recovering in the hospital…"
23:09:20  ANN  "He'll?"
23:10:04  ANN  "Call me"
23:10:38  DAN  "That's right HE'LL fracture more of your bones.
                HE'LL rape you again. Destroy your life even more"
                                                 ← READ BY HER IN 2 SECONDS
23:11:02  ANN  ".stpp…"
```

`He'll?` belongs to the same garble family as `Whst????` (23:23:57), `Dani`
(00:41:33) and `Post:. You're eight` (01:03:57). It was read as an invocation of
Coles. It was almost certainly *Hell?* — a request for clarification, followed
by a request to call, followed after the reply by *stop*.

**Dan appears to catch it 105 minutes later:**

```
00:55:51  DAN  "He'll :.."            ← quoting her garble back
00:56:12  ANN  "?"
00:57:50  DAN  "Wait "
00:58:32  DAN  "What the actual fuck"
00:59:59  DAN  ".,stpp."              ← quoting her second garble back
```

**Priming, which explains without excusing:** he had spent that afternoon
reading *harassment — subject another person to physical contact — guilty* and
*criminal mischief — damage property*. Maximum priming to parse an ambiguous
token as an invocation of the man. The message is unrecoverable by any framing,
and it is the artifact that most contradicts the restraint documented at
[[wiki/people/the-unnamed-man]].

## Corrections to earlier analysis of this night

Two readings produced in the first analytic pass are **retracted outright**, per
the corpus's standing retraction discipline.

**RETRACTED — "the research claim was a bluff."** At 00:32:25: *"I had to
finally pull the cord today and do the research… what the real threat vector is
in my life."* This is **literally true**; the research was executed at 19:01:22
that day. The accurate and narrower finding is **implicature**: a true statement
about research was placed adjacent to a timestamp list of different provenance,
and the adjacency was left to do the work. That is not fabrication.

**RETRACTED — "the third-party belief was constructed inside the thread."** The
prior reading held that silence produced an inference of betrayal which then
made her explanation for the silence necessarily a lie — a closed loop with no
external input. **The conversation was entered thirty-seven minutes after
completing a criminal-history profile.** The belief was primed by documented
external research. The circularity finding is dead and is not carried forward.

## Standing constraint on analysis of this page

> [[wiki/people/annie-ulmer]] establishes as its central finding that the gravest
> harm of the terminal phase was being told that an **accurate perception was
> itself a symptom of instability** — and the Corrective Addendum formally
> retracted an earlier wiki pass that credited the "Dan's vigilance is
> controlling behaviour" framing.
>
> Any analysis that explains the operator's inference by his **psychology**
> rather than evaluating it against **evidence** reproduces that harm. It has
> now done so at least twice in this corpus.
>
> **Legitimate:** "this inference is thin here, because the evidence is X."
> **Prohibited:** "you can't see this because you need it to be true."

## What August 16 settled about this night

> **RESOLVED [2026-08-20] — the inference this page could not confirm is now
> primary.** The whole of this night runs on an inference: that Annie's silence
> and read-receipt pattern meant she was with [[wiki/people/jerel-coles|Coles]].
> The page holds it as an inference and says so. Seven days later, on
> 2026-08-16 at ~23:37, Coles is audible on a live call from Annie's phone and
> types three messages from her handle — see
> [[wiki/timeline/events/august-2026-morgantown-call]]. The August 8 reading
> was correct on the fact of contact. It remains uncorroborated on that
> *night's* specifics, and this page should not be read as retroactively
> proven: what was established a week later is that the contact existed, not
> that any particular hour of August 8 was spent with him.

Two smaller corrections from the fuller export
(`raw/self/message-csv/imessage_export_2124702449_20260820.csv`, filed
2026-08-20, which covers this night in full):

- **The spine omits a message.** Between *"He'll?"* (23:09) and Dan's *"HE'LL
  rape you again"* (23:10) Annie also sent ***"Call me"*** at 23:10. It does
  not change the misparse reading — Dan answered the wrong message — but it is
  the only request for voice contact in the sequence and it went unanswered.
- **The night did not end at 03:41:32.** Dan answers at 08:19 the same morning
  and the exchange continues all day on August 9, ending with a mailbox drop of
  the money and *"I don't want you to go away."* This page's scope is the
  collapse, not the day, but the unanswered-final-message framing is a scope
  artifact rather than a fact about the relationship.

## Gaps

`annie_metadata_24h.csv` and `imessage_export_2124702449_20260809084846_.csv`
are the primary sources for every figure above and are not yet on disk in
`raw/` — see the sourcing note at the top of this page and `queue.md`. Whether
receipts were toggled off or the thread simply left unopened at ~02:25 is
explicitly undetermined (see above). A baseline read-latency profile from prior
weeks, needed to say whether the median-0s window is itself unusual, has not
been run.
